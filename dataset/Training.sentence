SEN:10012052	12734185	In fact, disruption of p53 in ob/ob mice completely suppressed the p53-regulated genes to wild-type levels and partially restored expression of lipogenic enzymes.
SEN:10012054	12734185	Thus, the activation of p53 might constitute a negative feedback loop against excess fat accumulation in adipocytes
SEN:10012060	14985341	This activation of the p53 pathway leads to the elevation of p21 mRNA expression, which can be considered an indicator of p53 activity,
SEN:10012064	1423616	Finally, IR induction of the human GADD45 gene, an induction that is also defective in AT cells, was dependent on wild-type p53 function. Wild-type but not mutant p53 bound strongly to a conserved element in the GADD45 gene, and a p53-containing nuclear factor, which bound this element, was detected in extracts from irradiated cells.
SEN:10012078	11807984	Furthermore, we found that Opn expression was upregulated by DNA damage-induced Tp53 activity and by adenovirus-mediated transfer of the human TP53 gene. In addition, a luciferase assay showed that the Opn gene has a functional Tp53-responsive element in its promoter region, and a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed interaction between the Opn promoter and Tp53 protein in vivo.
SEN:10012080	12067065	That hypothesis is consistent with the presence of a functional p53-response element within the promoter region of the mouse SIP gene and confirmed by the induction of SIP mRNA expression in mouse embryo fibroblasts upon activation of a p53-dependent pathway by transfection with rasV12 or rasV12/E1A
SEN:10012082	12734185	Consistently, reporter gene analysis showed that p53 overexpression suppressed the promoter activity of the SREBP-1c gene and its downstream genes.
SEN:10012086	12453409	During embryogenesis, REDD1 expression mirrors the tissue-specific pattern of the p53 family member p63, and TP63 null embryos show virtually no expression of REDD1, which is restored in mouse embryo fibroblasts following p63 expression.

SEN:10012100	16297464	The activation capacity of the related USF-2, c-Myc and HIF-2alpha proteins was lower compared to USF-1 suggesting that USF-1 is the major E-box-binding transcription factor regulating the Prnd promoter.

SEN:10012112	12117816	Translational repression of protamine 1 (Prm1) mRNA requires sequences present in its 3' untranslated region (UTR) and substantial evidence suggests a role for the murine Y-box protein MSY4 in this process
SEN:10012120	18687992	Chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays show the direct binding of Zfp143 to the Nanog proximal promoter. Knockdown of Zfp143 or mutation of the Zfp143 binding motif significantly downregulates Nanog proximal promoter activity. Importantly, enforced expression of Nanog is able to rescue the Zfp143 knockdown phenotype, indicating that Nanog is one of the key downstream effectors of Zfp143.
SEN:10015356	14764725	To confirm that antioxidants also affected functional, downstream effects of IKK activation, we examined cytoplasmic levels of IkBa in neutrophils treated with LPS alone or with LPS plus NAC or alphaTOC. In neutrophils challenged with LPS, IkBa underwent time-dependent degradation (Fig. 3B). However, in neutrophils incubated with LPS and either antioxidant, no degradation of IkBa was apparent.
SEN:10015378	19898975	Figure 1 shows that the addition of 100 ng/ml mouse recombinant visfatin for 18 h generates ROS in myotubes, which were partially inhibited by the antioxidant NAC (reduced by approximately 40%).
SEN:10015386	18566440	Because IFN-g is known to induce NOS2, an important mediator of inflammation and host defense, we also analyzed effects of acrolein exposure on LPS-mediated induction of NOS2 (28) and observed a strong trend toward reduced NOS2 expression after acrolein exposure
SEN:10015388	18566440	LPS-induced production of Th1 cytokines, especially IFN-g, again appeared to be reduced by acrolein exposure (Fig. 6C), although no statistically significant effects were seen on LPS-induced induction of mRNA of these cytokines (data not shown).

SEN:10015436	18155543	Treatment of VSMCs with AG-II was observed to induce premature cellular senescence (overexpression of p53/p21) and increase the production of proinflammatory cytokines through nuclear factor-B activation; both effects were neutralized by blocking the p21 pathway.97 The same effects of AG-II were also observed in vivo in a mouse model of atherosclerosis.97
SEN:10015438	18762784	Furthermore, angiotensin II increased the proportion of senescent VSMCs and induced the expression of proinflammatory molecules, as well as p21, in aortic atherosclerotic lesions in a mouse model of atherosclerosis.33

SEN:10015482	17992263	MMP-9 activity was significantly upregulated in BALF at day 1 in C57BL/6 mice but not in MyD88–/– mice, and only partially in IL-1R1–/– mice (Figure 4A).
SEN:10015486	17209037	The former studies demonstrate that TGF-1 and bleomycin are potent stimulators of the propeptide and mature forms of MMP-12 (Fig. 10,Aand B).
SEN:10015488	17992263	Latent TGF-?1 was detected after activation in BALF from WT mice 7 days after BLM administration, but was not detected in BALF from MyD88- or IL-1R1–deficient mice (Figure 5G)
SEN:10015494	10744722	As shown in Fig. 3A in normal cells, IR causes activation of Chk2/Cds1 (lane 2), and this activation is inhibited by prior treatment of cells with caffeine (lane 4).
SEN:10015496	10744722	Immediately after IR, an increase in serine 216-phosphorylated Cdc25C was observed in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 1B, lane 2), and prior treatment of cells with caffeine inhibited this increase (Fig. 1B, lane 4).
SEN:10015498	10744722	As shown in Fig. 6A, ATM immunoprecipitated from irradiated cells was more active than that from unirradiated cells, and both the basal and radiationinduced ATM activities were inhibited by caffeine with an IC50 at around 200 M.

In FG2 cell lines the levels of p27BBP mRNA and protein were totally unchanged (Fig. 3a,b). In contrast, in HaCaT cells the levels of p27BBP mRNA were similar to the control, but protein levels were significantly decreased.
SEN:10015584	10783130	IL-1b stimulation of A549 cells released GM-CSF, whereas levels were undetectable without stimulation. Coincubation with the transcriptional blocker actinomycin D and the translational blocker cycloheximide totally inhibited GM-CSF production after IL-1b stimulation (Figure 1A),
SEN:10015590	18342602	Importantly, cycloheximide treatment also completely suppressed PERK (Thr980) phosphorylation in both Tsc1-/- and Tsc2-/- cells (Figure S1C), supporting the hypothesis that increased protein synthesis is likely the underlying mechanism for activation of UPR in TSC1- and TSC2-deficient cells.

SEN:10015726	14747657	Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in NIH 3T3 cells, we show that heme, an inducer of ho-1, promotes displacement of Bach1 from the MafK-occupied ho-1 enhancers, which is followed by Nrf2 binding to these elements.
SEN:10015728	17682061	As shown in Fig. ?Fig.3A,3A, FLAG-Bach1 was rather stable in the absence of hemin, but it disappeared more rapidly in the presence of hemin. Its half-life was shortened less than 1 h by the presence of hemin (Fig. ?(Fig.3B).3B). We conclude that heme induces degradation of Bach1 in vivo.
SEN:10015730	17682061	An immunoblotting analysis of the precipitates with an anti-HA antibody revealed that polyubiquitination of FLAG-Bach1 or FLAG-MafK was not apparent under normal conditions (Fig. 4A and B).

Moreover, these increases were significantly reduced by the pre or posttreatment with PP1 at 4 or 24 h post-LPS (by 71 and 81% vs LPS, respectively, p 0.05).
SEN:10016014	15489375	LPS-induced neutrophil accumulation into the lung was significantly inhibited by prior intraperitoneal administration of neutralizing antibody against murine TNF-?, suggesting that TNF-? plays a critical role in the LPS-mediated neutrophil trafficking into the airway

SEN:10016094	19768117	To determine if BAX and BAK are activated in response to NO, wild type MEFs were treated with DETA-NO for 24 hours and BAX and BAK activation was determined using antibodies that specifically recognize the activated form of these proteins [20], [23]. Indeed, BAX and BAK are activated in response to NO treatment indicating that both of these proteins regulate NO-mediated apoptosis (Figure 1E/FFigure 1).
SEN:10016100	19768117	To determine if NO activates JNK upstream of BAX and BAK, we treated Bax?/?/Bak?/? MEFs with DETA-NO and assessed JNK activity by measuring expression of phoshpo-cJun, a downstream target of JNK. NO activates JNK as early as 8 hours after exposure to NO, and this activation was sustained to 24 hours (Figure 6AFigure 6).

SEN:10016152	20348279	This revealed that the C/EBPa antibody disrupted the 3rd DNAprotein complex (Fig. 7C, “”) and supershifted the complex (Fig. 7C, arrow), whereas rabbit IgG had no effect. These results indicated that the binding of C/EBPa to the C/EBP binding site on the HO-1 promoter is specific and increased by PGN.
SEN:10016154	20348279	In the presence of PGN (Fig. 5, filled bars), Elk-1 and Ets-2 further increased HO-1 promoter activity by 12.2- and 7.5-fold, respectively, compared with baseline pCI control (P 0.05; Fig. 5A).

SEN:10016778	14646587	Here we showed that STAT5a was phosphorylated 10 min after desferrioxamine (DFO) treatment, and reached a maximum induction at 4 h in mammary epithelial cells (HC11) and transfected COS-7 cells. Under hypoxic conditions (2% O2), a maximal phosphorylation of STAT5a was observed within 6 h. These results showed that DFO or hypoxia induces tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5a.
SEN:10016780	14646587	EMSA (electrophoretic mobility shift assay) showed that DFO or hypoxia enhanced the binding activities of STAT5a DNA to beta-casein gene promoter in mammary epithelial cells (HC11) and transfected COS-7 cells. (taof is inferred from increased phosphorylation and increased promoter binding)
SEN:10016824	12088279	PGF2alpha is able to inhibit Pparg functions in adipogenesis. This occurs through subsequent Pparg phosphorylation and inhibition of its transcriptional activity.
SEN:10016832	16124869	In cells treated with DTT, the level of c-myc mRNA was not increased until 2 h after treatment in wild-type cells (Figure 2B). By contrast, no significant change in c-myc mRNA levels was observed in Perk-/- MEFs upon DTT treatment (Figure 2B), indicating that the induction of c-myc expression by DTT is PERK-dependent.

SEN:10017004	11815629	Again, in control cells, cytochrome c was localized in the mitochondria, whereas in the presence of LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor), cytochrome c was released into the cytosol. Similarly, treatment with 4-OHT strongly induced cytochrome c release into the cytosol in FKHR-L1(A3):ER* Ba/F3 cells.
SEN:10017040	21317532	we treated cells with IFN-g, resulting in a several-fold increase in monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) expression. Nicotinic acid strongly inhibited this effect in macrophages from WT but not from GPR109A-deficient mice (Figure 6A).
SEN:10017060	18824549	(from text) Similar to EGFR, our studies demonstrated that ADAM17 surface expression on lung epithelial cells was up-regulated in IL-13 transgenic mice (Fig. 3, f and g) and OVA-sensitized and challenged mice (Fig. 3f).
SEN:10017062	18824549	(from text) Using this method, we successfully compared the levels of intracellular AMCase in lung epithelial cells from control mice, mice sensitized and challenged with OVA, and IL-13-overexpressing transgenic animals. These studies demonstrated a significant increase in intracellular AMCase in both of the modeling systems (Fig. 2, a–d).
SEN:10017064	18824549	(from text) The increase in intracellular AMCase in these Th2 inflammation/asthma models was paralleled by an increase of total EGFR in lung lysates (Fig. 3a) as well as specific EGFR surface expression on lung epithelial cells as analyzed by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 3b) and flow cytometry (Fig. 3, c and d).
SEN:10017094	10207013	Stimulation of EC with TNF-a and/or Ox-LDL for 24 h increased the number of MT1-MMP-bearing cells to about 1.8-fold (Ox-LDL), 1.7-fold (TNF-a), or 2.5-fold (TNF-a and Ox-LDL together) as compared with unstimulated cells (Fig. 6B - flow cytometric analysis of HSVEC using purified mouse monoclonal antibody to human MT1- MMP.)
SEN:10017202	10698680	PDK1 was first identified by its ability to phosphorylate Thr308 of PKBa in vitro [17,29,30]. As this activity was absolutely dependent on the inclusion of PtdIns(3,4)P2 or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in the reaction mixture
SEN:10017208	10074452	Here, using rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells transiently transfected with a plasmid expressing a chimera of green fluorescent protein fused to GAP1(m) (GFP-GAP1(m)), we show that epidermal growth factor (EGF) induces a rapid (less than 60 seconds) recruitment of GFP-GAP1(m) from the cytosol to the plasma membrane.
SEN:10017240	10946303	Treatment with 30 ng/ml TNF-a or 1 mM TPA led to a 3.2- or 5.2-fold increase, respectively, in COX-2 promoter activity, these effects being inhibited by 64% or 54%, respectively, by 100 mM PDTC (Fig. 12A).
SEN:10017306	17053832	Figure 6 and p 3018: lipid infusion markedly inhibited insulin-stimulated insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) phosphorylation in skeletal muscle of WT mice...This was substantially attenuated in TLR4 -/- mice.

SEN:10017410	18794886	(Harrington et al., 2004). The mechanism of this transcriptional repression depends on the activation of mTORC1 signaling, as rapamycin treatment and silencing of S6K genes restores IRS-1 levels.
SEN:10017424	20038814	Because the enhanced NF-kB signaling in Tsc2-/- MEFs was abolished by rapamycin treatment, NF-kB signaling appeared to be downstream of mTORC1 (Figure 10A).
SEN:10017566	17548647	In WT mice, MMP-12 was induced upon exposure to cigarette smoke, as shown by Western blots on lung homogenates from WT nonsmoke exposed and smoke-exposed mice (Fig. 6A).

SEN:10017590	19027064	Western blot analysis of lung proteins showed that Srx1 proteinwas present constitutively, and its level increased significantly on exposure to CS in Nrf2+/+ mice. By contrast, expression of Srx1 protein was low in Nrf2?/? mice and did not change significantly with CS exposure (Figs. 1B and C).
SEN:10017644	19027064	Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2-/- mice were exposed to CS for 5 h and then examined for expression of Srx1 by real-time RT-PCR. Srx1 mRNA level was upregulated by eight-fold in response to CS in Nrf2+/+ mice. No induction was observed in the lungs of CS-exposed Nrf2-/- mice (Fig. 1A).

SEN:10017810	10946303	TNF-a induced COX-2 expression in NCI-H292 cells. When the cells were exposed to 10 ng/ml of IL-1b, TNF-a, or IFN-g, 1 mg/ml of LPS, or 1 mM TPA, only TNF-a and TPA stimulated COX-2 expression (data not shown).
SEN:10017828	10194465	Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), the class of insulin sensitizers that act through the nuclear receptor PPAR-g, increase CAP expression levels and c-Cbl phosphorylation significantly in adipocytes (54), possibly contributing to their insulin sensitizing effect

SEN:10017894	12226756	Ablation of RALT expression by MEK- 1 inhibitors is caused by suppression of RALT transcription, as indicated by the Northern blot analysis presented in Figure 3.
SEN:10017948	18762784	For example, aging decreases the stability of hypoxia-inducible factor 1? (HIF-1? )—a transcription factor that mediates the adaptive response to hypoxia— resulting in decreased expression of stromalcell- derived factor and vascular endothelial growth factor.65,66
SEN:10017960	10022831	Cell adhesion is critical for receptor activation based on two experimental observations: (i) VEGF-A165-dependent VEGFR-2 phosphorylation was strongly activated in adherent cell, but showed a substantially reduced response in suspended cells; and

SEN:10018016	10446041	(38). Integrins also stimulate the p70 S6- kinase, which may promote cyclin D1 translation (39). Finally, anchorage to the ECM is necessary for the down-regulation of the Cdk 2 inhibitors p21 and p27 and, thus, the activation of cyclin E-Cdk 2
SEN:10018018	10446041	PTP-PEST has a COOH-terminal extension that anchors it to the cytosolic aspect of the endoplasmic reticulum. Integrin-mediated adhesion activates calpain, a protease that cleaves this extension and allows the phosphatase to relocate to focal adhesions (21).

SEN:10018060	10446041	Whereas FAK is phosphorylated on tyrosine upon assembly of focal adhesions, it becomes phosphorylated on serine and disassociates from Src and p130CAS during mitosis (14). These events may loosen cell-substrate contacts and allow cells to divide and move apart.
SEN:10018072	11806755	In both BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, a neutrophil infiltration was observed after the sequential application of lipopolysaccharide and N-Formyl-Met-Leu-Phe. However, 5 times less neutrophil was found in C57BL/6 mice when compared to BALB/c mice. This was reflected in the neutrophil activation parameters measured (myeloperoxidase and elastase activities).

SEN:10018096	12871976	ER stress induces CREB1 phosphorylation and ATF1/CREB1 binding to the Grp78 promoter. Through the use of adenoviral vector expression systems, we provide evidence that when ATF4 function is suppressed and its binding partners are not able to compensate for its function, Grp78 induction by Tg and Tu is partially inhibited.
SEN:10018098	16680093	In this study, we report that TNFR1 has a crucial role in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) activation.
SEN:10018100	16680093	As shown in Fig 1C, ER stressinduced JNK activation was recovered in RIP-reconstituted RIP-/- cells, even though the protein level of RIP was much lower in RIP-reconstituted cells than in WT cells (Fig 1B). These results indicate that RIP, like TRAF2, is essential for JNK activation in response to ER stress.
SEN:10018102	12840028	Recently, Novoa et al. (29, 31) demonstrated that GADD34, also known as Myd116 in mouse, promotes the dephosphorylation of eIF-2alpha and is induced by both ER stress and amino acid deprivation.
SEN:10018104	10856300	ATF6 has been implicated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response pathway since it can activate expression of GRP78 and other genes induced by the ER stress response. ER stress appears to activate ATF6 by cleavage from the ER membrane and translocation to the nucleus
SEN:10018116	15545625	Here we show that mTOR inhibition by hypoxia requires the TSC1/TSC2 tumor suppressor complex and the hypoxia-inducible gene REDD1/RTP801. Disruption of the TSC1/TSC2 complex through loss of TSC1 or TSC2 blocks the effects of hypoxia on mTOR, as measured by changes in the mTOR targets S6K and 4EBP1, and results in abnormal accumulation of Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF).

SEN:10018160	20158611	Collectively, these results demonstrate that hypoxic hepatocytes activate latent TGF-beta1 and that this stimulates hepatocyte EMT.
SEN:10018162	15592500	As evident from Figure 1a, the 10-fold increase in VEGF mRNA induced in mouse embryonic fibroblasts under hypoxia was not matched by a similar increase in the amount of secreted protein, which was merely two-fold.

SEN:10018176	10436023	<B8> c-Abl phosphorylates DNA-PK in the C-terminal region (amino acids 3414?3850) (Jin et al., 1997). c-Abl-dependent phosphorylation of DNA-PK is stimulated by IR (Kharbanda et al., 1997). c-Abl does not phosphorylate Ku (Kharbanda et al., 1997).
SEN:10018178	10436023	<N12> Rad51 binds to c-Abl directly (Yuan et al., 1998). c-Abl phosphorylates Rad51 Tyr54, as a consequence of which the binding of Rad51 to ssDNA is inhibited (Yuan et al., 1998). IR induces c-Abl-dependent phosphorylation of Rad51 (Yuan et al., 1998).

SEN:10018192	20338999	Osmotic stress caused a decrease in DAP5 protein levels in both S/S and A/A cells (Fig. 3A), in agreement with the decreased translation of DAP5 mRNA (Fig. 3C).
SEN:10018194	20338999	hnRNP A1 levels increased in the cytoplasm of stressed S/S, but not A/A cells (Fig. 4A), showing that the cytoplasmic accumulation of hnRNP A1 during osmotic stress requires eIF2a phosphorylation.
SEN:10018196	20338999	As expected, hypertonic stress caused cytochrome c release from mitochondria in S/S but not in A/A cells (supplemental Fig. 1B) consistent with the increase in mitochondria-induced apoptosis in the former cells.

SEN:10019638	17658277	These results indicate that LPS induces autophagy through a TRIF-dependent TLR4 signaling pathway.
SEN:10019640	17658277	We reasoned that these same pathways might be involved in downstream signaling of TLR4/TRIF/RIP1 pathway.
SEN:10019642	20375303	In peritoneal macrophages, however, TRIF was also required for normal induction of TNF-alpha mRNA, suggesting cell type-related functions of TRIF.
SEN:10019646	18772134	Interestingly, signaling through TLR1 or TLR3 induced similar responses, despite their use of different adaptor proteins, MydD88 for TLR1 and Trif for TLR3.
SEN:10019648	19570822	Furthermore, activation of TLRs 2, 3 and 7 also induced priming of the NLRP3 inflammasome and macrophages lacking TLRs for the respective stimuli failed to activate caspase-1 after activation via ATP (Fig. 2B).

SEN:10019654	16798732	When compared with an equimolar concentration of palmitate, fibroblast-stimulating lipopeptide-1, a known TLR2 ligand, was a slightly more potent activator of signal transduction and interleukin (IL)-6 production.
SEN:10019656	18422969	Similar findings were observed with other agonists of TLR2 including the synthetic lipoprotein FSL-1 and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) (data not shown). The TLR5 agonist flagellin reduced PPARgamma mRNA abundance to a lesser extent
SEN:10019660	19855386	Furthermore, pre-treatment of macrophages with the TLR3 ligand poly(I:C), which only uses TRIF signaling11, markedly suppressed tunicamycin-induced CHOP expression (Fig. 2d).
SEN:10019662	18772134	exposure to the TLR4 ligand LPS triggered both MyD88 and Trif to recruit Beclin 1, whereas exposure to the TLR3 ligand poly(I:C) led to an increased association between Trif and Beclin 1 (Fig. 4A).
SEN:10019670	16510838	The TLR3 agonist poly (I:C) significantly increased bidirectional secretion of CCL2, IL6, TNFA and CSF2 and basolateral secretion of CSF3.

SEN:10019682	17053832	Similarly, insulin-stimulated glycolysis appeared to be suppressed to a lesser extent in TLR4-/- mice after lipid infusion as compared with WT mice
SEN:10019684	17053832	Moreover, mice lacking TLR4 are substantially protected from the ability of systemic lipid infusion to (a) suppress insulin signaling in muscle and (b) reduce insulin-mediated changes in systemic glucose metabolism.
SEN:10019686	15650774	To obtain direct evidence of TLR activation upon THP engagement, we isolated bone marrow–derived macrophages from MyD88 and TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 KO mice as well as from WT mice. While THP potently stimulated TNF-? production in APCs obtained from WT, TLR2–/–, and TLR9–/– mice, cells from TLR4–/– and MyD88–/– mice were completely resistant to THP or LPS stimulation (Figure ?(Figure6A).6A)
SEN:10019688	15650774	THP activates myeloid DCs via Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) to acquire a fully mature DC phenotype...To investigate a role of TLR4 in THP-induced immune cell activation, human DCs were preincubated with the anti-TLR4 Ab, mAb HTA-125, and a significant impairment of cytokine production was observed (Figure ?(Figure5C).5C). These results indicate a critical role of TLR4 in THP-mediated immunostimulatory effects on DCs.

SEN:10019702	18772134	TLR4 links to both MyD88 and Trif, TLR3 exclusively uses Trif, and the other TLRs use MyD88 as their major adaptor to transduce signals to downstream effectors (4).
SEN:10019706	18772134	These data strongly suggest that ligand activated TLR4 assembles signaling complexes that contained MyD88, Trif, Irak4, and Beclin 1.
SEN:10019720	19842832	Studies using TLR-4 -/- mice have demonstrated that induction of MCP-1 in BAL fluid upon exposure of mice to subacute (exposed for a period of 5 weeks) levels of CS depends on the presence of wild-type TLR-4, whereas TLR-4 plays a minor role in MCP-1 induction in the presence of chronic smoke exposure (26 weeks) [45].
SEN:10019722	21220332	Treatment of control cells with LPS substantially increased the mRNA of p62 along with that of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) and peroxiredoxin 1 (Prdx1), known Nrf2 target genes (Fig. 4F and Fig. S4G) (25, 26), demonstrating activation of Nrf2 in LPSstimulated cells.

SEN:10019736	16979664	A cytokine release assay using antibodies to Tumor Necrosis Factor-alfa (TNF) was performed (Fig. 3D). TNF- release in response to HSP70 and (to a lesser extent) following ssPolyU treatment was blunted in SiRNA-TLR7 transfected RAW264.7 cells versus the parental cells or mocktransfected cells
SEN:10019742	18079962	Herein we show that TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor (TRAIL-R), the only proapoptotic death-signaling receptor for TRAIL in the mouse, suppresses inflammation and tumorigenesis.
SEN:10019750	9743536	This receptor has been shown to specifically bind to the tumor necrosis factor (ligand) superfamily, member 13b (TNFSF13B/TALL-1/BAFF), and to lead to NF-kappaB and MAPK8/JNK activation.
SEN:10019760	16141211	These responses to TNFalpha were absent in TNFR2-/- and TNFR1/2-/- myofibroblasts, whereas TNFR1-/- cells showed similar responses to WT.

Src specific inhibitors PD-161430, PP1 or PP2 blocked TNF induced cell migration. Loss of TNFR2 (MCER2-/- cells) inhibited SRC activation.
SEN:10019768	15894279	Survivin was expressed after triggering OX40, and this was not dependent on cell division, as significant expression was retained in the presence of hydroxyurea, aphidicolin, and nocodazole (Figure 3B).
SEN:10019772	17641007	Here we show that OX40 (CD134) signaling inhibits TGF-beta-driven Foxp3 mRNA and suppresses the conversion of naive Ag-specific transgenic CD4 T cells into CD25(+)Foxp3(+) T cells.
SEN:10019774	14635034	As demonstrated in Fig. 3A, blockade of the OX40/OX40L interaction significantly reduced the Th1-specific transcription factor T-bet to 30.8% compared with controls (p=0.007). On the other hand, expression of IL-10, a cytokine that was shown to be protective in chronic DSS-induced colitis [29], increased 3.6-fold (p=0.008).
SEN:10019776	14635034	IL- 10 secretion increased 20-fold (p X 0.0001). This was accompanied by a significant, 18-fold, increase of IL-5 secretion. IFNG levels were not altered, but IL-6 secretion was reduced to 60% compared with controls.
SEN:10019786	10892748	The TNFR1-containing fibroblasts had significantly higher levels of JNK activation than the TNFR2-containing fibroblasts ( Figure 5A), substantiating TRADD as the more effective initiator of TRAF2 signaling.

SEN:10019806	15729359	Thus, the pair netrin-1/UNC5H2 may regulate cell fate by controlling the proapoptotic kinase activity of DAP-kinase.
SEN:10019808	19158396	Considering that vinculin stabilizes FAs and thereby decreases cell migration (Ziegler et al., 2006), the contribution of this protein to both increased FA content and lower migration of T-FGM and MEF AhR-/- fibroblast (Mulero-Navarro et al., 2005; Gomez- Duran et al., 2009) deserves further consideration.
SEN:10019816	18769721	To determine if XIAP enhanced proinflammatory gene expression in vivo, we performed qRT-PCR analysis on splenic RNA from WT and XIAP knockout mice. RNA was isolated from splenocytes harvested from uninfected animals or animals infected with L. monocytogenes for 48 h (Figure 6) {to activate XIAP}. The expression of il6 and ifng mRNAs were significantly enhanced in the presence of XIAP during infection.
SEN:10019822	15187092	Tristetraprolin (TTP) is an mRNA-destabilizing protein that negatively regulates the expression of proinflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and cyclooxygenase 2
SEN:10019824	12089357	calcium-independent pathways are accounted for in part by MAPK activation (Rap1/B-Raf/MAPK-ERK kinase/ERK1/2) AtT-20 corticotrophs express B-Raf, as do other cells in which cAMP stimulates MAPK. CRH/cAMP stimulated ERK2 (Mapk1) activity and increased transcriptional activity of a Gal4-Elk1 protein, which was blocked by overexpression of dominant negative mutants and kinase inhibitors and stimulated by expression of B-Raf.
SEN:10019838	10397760	Transport of this heteromeric complex is dependent on the correct assembly of the component parts, which is controlled, in part, by the association of incompletely assembled Ig heavy chains with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone, BiP

SEN:10019846	13130303	The mechanism by which YC-1 reduces HIF-1a levels has not been established. HIF-1a interacts with the chaperone HSP90, and the HSP90 inhibitor 17-allyl-aminogeldanamycin (17-AAG) induces HIF-1a degradation in a VHL-independent manner 84 86, indicating that HSP90 is required for HIF-1a stability.

SEN:10019862	10725329	When applied locally to a passive cell edge, HA promoted the formation of lamellipodial protrusions in the direction of the stimulus. This process was inhibited by the prior injection of cells with dominant-negative N17Rac recombinant protein or by pretreatment of cells with monoclonal anti-CD44 antibodies, interfering with HA binding, implying the direct involvement of CD44 in signaling to Rac1.
SEN:10019892	19359411	IL-12 activates STAT4, which is a critical regulator of inflammation and T helper type I (Th1) lineage development in murine systems.
SEN:10019894	11397944	Thus, absence of IL-12 led to the shortest burst of IFN-g synthesis, and IL-12 significantly prolonged this duration, which was increased further by the addition of IL-18, a signal known to interact with IL-12 (27)
SEN:10019898	10097133	Interleukin 12 (IL-12)-induced T helper 1 (Th1) development requires Stat4 activation. Using subtractive cloning, we identified ERM, an Ets transcription factor, to be a Th1-specific, IL-12-induced gene. IL-12-induction of ERM occurred in wild-type and Stat1-deficient, but not Stat4-deficient, T cells, suggesting ERM is Stat4-inducible.

SEN:10020696	12909585	we treated quiescent fibroblasts with IL-1 or IFN-, and RNA was harvested and analyzed (Fig. 6). Treatment with IL-1 alone and with IL-1 in combination with IFN- completely abolished fibulin-5 mRNA expression.
SEN:10020744	19570822	We made use of the fact that heterologous overexpression of MyD88 activates downstream signaling and therefore expressed the Nlrp3 promoter luciferase construct alone or together with MyD88. Indeed, co-expression of the Nlrp3 promoter-luciferase construct with MyD88 led to a ~10-fold induction of luciferase activity indicating that MyD88-mediated signaling can activate the promoter of Nlrp3.

SEN:10021272	10080909	Using these methods, we found that JAK2 was essential for signal transduction but that loss of TYK2 made no appreciable difference in tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream molecules, including Mpl, STAT3, and Shc (33).....In fact, tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs and DNA binding assays seem to be almost interchangeable measures of transcriptional activity.
SEN:10021276	11090623	Sixth, based upon the activity of different forms of VEGF ligands, VEGFR2 but not VEGFR1 ligation was capable of activating integrins, and this conclusion was confirmed by overexpression of VEGFR2 in cells.
SEN:10021280	11134016	Using purified wild-type and mutant c-Raf-1 proteins, we demonstrate that Thr(269) is the major c-Raf-1 site phosphorylated by KSR in vitro and that phosphorylation of this site is essential for c-Raf-1 activation by KSR.
SEN:10021282	10446041	Yes and Lck are known to be enriched in rafts and may mediate the activation of Shc when Fyn is not expressed.
SEN:10021288	11294912	Y-27632, a specific inhibitor of ROCK, inhibited LIM-kinase-induced cofilin phosphorylation but did not affect fibronectin-induced or TESK1-induced cofilin phosphorylation in HeLa cells.

SEN:10021334	10660621	Furthermore, Erk-2 phosphorylated threonine 1179 and serine 1185 (and to a lesser extent, serine 395) in vitro, suggesting the importance of this pathway for SRC-1 regulation.
SEN:10021336	10733581	Indeed, ERK directly phosphorylates TTF-1 at three serine residues, and concomitant mutation of these serines to alanines completely abolishes ERK-mediated phosphorylation both in vitro and in vivo.
SEN:10021342	10446041	Integrin signaling may be needed for the transcription of cyclin D1, because the cyclin D1 promoter is coordinately regulated by JNK and ERK (37) (Fig. 4).
SEN:10021360	10075927	JNK1 phosphorylates E2F1 in vitro, and co-transfection of JNK1 reduces the DNA binding activity of E2F1;
SEN:10021362	10521505	Here, we report that Ser-727 phosphorylation of Stat3 can also be induced by JNK and activated either by stress or by its upstream kinase and that various stress treatments induce serine phosphorylation of Stat3 in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation
SEN:10021364	10446041	Activated JNK enters the nucleus and phosphorylates the transcription factor c-Jun, which combines with c-Fos to form the AP-1 transcription factor complex.
SEN:10021366	10779545	At least two p38-dependent 5-LO kinase activities were found. Based on migration properties in in-gel kinase assays and immunoreactivity, one of these was identified as mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAP kinase 2). The other appeared to be MAPKAP kinase 3
SEN:10021370	10542369	We have shown that MAP/microtubule affinity regulating kinases (MARK) can phosphorylate the microtubule-associated-proteins MAP4, MAP2c, and tau on their microtubule-binding domain in vitro. This leads to their detachment from microtubules (MT) and an increased dynamic instability of MT. In CHO cells expressing MARK1 or MARK2 under control of an inducible promoter, MARK2 phosphorylates an endogenous MAP4-related protein.
SEN:10021372	10436023	<C39> Cdc25C Ser216 also binds and is phosphorylated by CTAK1 (Peng et al., 1998). Cdc25C Ser216 is phosphorylated throughout interphase but not in mitosis (Peng et al., 1997).
SEN:10021374	11057898	Rapamycin blocks both 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and cap-dependent translation ( [6]), and mTOR has been demonstrated to phosphorylate 4E-BP1 directly (discussed in further detail below) ( [14]).
SEN:10021376	10660304	A STAT3 peptide was efficiently phosphorylated on Ser727 in a CNTF-dependent manner by mTOR, but not by a kinase-inactive mTOR mutant or by p70 S6 kinase.

SEN:10021384	10945974	Consistent with the earlier results, p42/44 MAPK and its upstream kinase MEK1/2 were activated in a time-dependent manner by the induction of Pak1 (Fig. 3C).
SEN:10021386	11062502	Examination of whole cell lysates from the same NK92 cells showed that kinase-deficient (KD) PAK1, unlike control CD56, also effectively suppressed MEK and ERK activation by target ligation (Fig. 7b). Thus, PAK1 is upstream of both MEK and ERK in the NK lytic process.
SEN:10021392	11278822	consistent with an antiapoptotic function, expression of PAK4 leads to an increase in phosphorylation of the proapoptotic protein Bad and an inhibition of caspase activation.
SEN:10021398	10480933	Here, we show that the isolated N-terminal kinase of RSK2 (amino acids 1-360) is phosphorylated at Ser(227) by PDK1, a constitutively active kinase, leading to 100-fold stimulation of kinase activity
SEN:10021400	10856237	The N-terminal kinase is activated by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) through phosphorylation of Ser227, and phosphorylates the substrates of RSK.
SEN:10021402	10698680	PDK1 has now been shown to play a central role in activating many of the AGC subfamily members (reviewed in [150,151]). Apart from phosphorylating PKB on Thr308, PDK1 phosphorylates the equivalent residues on PKC isoforms [48,152,153], p70-S6K [32,154], the three isoforms of SGK [27,28,155] and PKA [156] (Figure 6).
SEN:10021404	10698680	As purified or recombinant PDK1 only phosphorylated Thr308 of PKBa and not Ser473, it was assumed that the phosphorylation of Ser473 would be catalysed by a distinct protein kinase, tentatively termed PDK2 [29]. Recent evidence (discussed below) suggests that PDK1 itself, rather than a distinct kinase, may phosphorylate PKB on Ser473 in vivo.
SEN:10021406	10805725	Both enzymes are characterized by the presence of a C2 domain at the carboxy terminus and, in vitro, preferentially utilize phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate as lipid substrates.
SEN:10021408	11278864	we found that MCP-1 triggered monocyte adhesion and activation of the PI3Kalpha isoform, but not PI3Kgamma in purified human monocytes. PI3K activation correlated temporally with our functional studies. Furthermore, PI3K was necessary for the chemokine-triggered conversion of monocyte rolling to firm adhesion and sufficient to enhance monocyte arrest under physiological flow conditions.
SEN:10021412	10436023	<C41> Cyclin B is degraded late in mitosis through the ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3) activity of the anaphase-promoting complex, which is probably activated by phosphorylation by Plk1 (Glover et al., 1998).
SEN:10021414	10436023	<C37> The Cdc25C N-terminal domain can also be phosphorylated by Plk1 (Hamanaka et al., 1994). During mitosis, Plk1, by way of its polo boxes, localizes progressively to the centromeres, spindle poles, centrosomes, and spindle midzone or midbody (Glover et al., 1998; Lee et al., 1998c).
SEN:10021418	10856305	In vitro, PKC directly phosphorylated platelet syntaxin 4 and recombinant syntaxin 4. PKC phosphorylation in vitro inhibited (71 +/- 8%) the binding of syntaxin 4 to SNAP-23.
SEN:10021422	11035810	Consistent with this in vivo activity, PKAc enzyme efficiently phosphorylated GSK-3a and -b at serine 21 and 9 in vitro (Fig. 4B), which was blocked by addition of the PKA peptide inhibitor (PKI) (26).
SEN:10021424	10497232	inhibition of PKCalpha expression caused an increase in IRS phosphorylation by the insulin receptor this effect was independent of insulin
SEN:10021428	10508235	Protein kinase C (PKC) seems to be involved in negative regulation of the alpha -receptor, since overexpression of PKC-alpha suppressed the expression of the alpha -receptor but not the beta -receptor (125).
SEN:10021430	10551823	Upon the activation of protein kinase C S100A8/A9 heterodimers are released from human monocytes by a novel secretion pathway that is energy-consuming and depends on an intact microtubule network
SEN:10021436	10905472	PKC, a serine kinase, can phosphorylate and inhibit tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor as well as tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1
SEN:10021440	10436023	<B5> DNA-PK phosphorylates itself, thereby blocking its interaction with Ku:DNA complex and inhibiting its kinase activity; it also phosphorylates Ku70 . Ku80, but without effect (Chan and Lees-Miller, 1996).
SEN:10021442	10085136	First, we generated site-specific CADTK mutants. Mutation of Tyr402 eliminated autophosphorylation and significantly decreased kinase activity.

SEN:10021460	10882136	Previous studies have suggested a role for the Rsk1 kinase in the PMA induction of NF-kB; however, Rsk1 phosphorylates only S32 of IkBalpha.
SEN:10021466	10856237	Here, we identify Ser386 in the hydrophobic motif of RSK2 as a phosphorylation-dependent docking site and activator of PDK1
SEN:10021468	11189448	we showed that HSF 1 is phosphorylated by the protein kinase RSK2 in vitro we demonstrate that RSK2 slightly represses activation of HSF1 in vivo

SEN:10021486	11029459	Each of three Ki-ras(G12V) transfectants responded to TGF-beta1 by an increase in proliferation and by decreasing the abundance of the Cdk inhibitor p21 and the tumor suppressor PTEN, whereas each of three wild-type Ki-ras transfectants remained unresponsive to TGF-beta1.
SEN:10021490	10882715	We show here that activated ACK1, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that belongs to the focal adhesion kinase family, causes tyrosine phosphorylation of Ras-GRF1.
SEN:10021494	10436023	<C27> p45Skp2 inhibits Cdk2 kinase activity and blocks phosphorylation of Cdk2 by Wee1 or CAK (Yam et al., 1999). Similarly to p21Cip1, two molecules of p45Skp2 seem to be required to inhibit Cdk2. Binding to p45Skp2 is mutually exclusive with p21cip1.
SEN:10021498	11847100	Inactivation of cytoplasmic c-Abl by the kinase-inactive Abl-PP-K(-) (AblP242E/P249E/K290M) or by microinjection of Abl neutralizing antibodies inhibited mitogenesis.
SEN:10021504	22421041	Combined blockade of Alk1 and Notch signaling further exacerbates hypervascularization, whereas activation of Alk1 by its high-affinity ligand BMP9 rescues hypersprouting induced by Notch inhibition
SEN:10021506	17068149	BMP9 also activates the Id1 promoter-derived BMP response element (BRE) in a dose-dependent manner (EC50 = 45 +/-; 27 pg/ml) and this activation is abolished by silencing ALK1 expression
SEN:10021508	15284439	We identified this kinase to be the G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (Grk2), and we showed that it acts on S633 in the C terminus of ?-ENaC. The kinase increases the activity of the channels and renders them insensitive to the ubiquitin protein ligase Nedd4-2.
SEN:10021512	22003059	ROS production with ischemia was significantly reduced in lungs with knockout of Akt1 while the response of Akt2 null lungs to ischemia was similar to wild type (Fig. 4A and B). Thus, Akt1 is required for activation of endothelial ROS production with ischemia.
SEN:10021518	16443763	Cyclins D1 and D2 but not D3 protein levels were markedly increased in caAktTg/cdk4/ mice (4.1 1 and 1.9 0.1, respectively, P 0.05) (Fig. 1C–E).
SEN:10021520	16443763	Levels of p21 were significantly increased in caAktTg mice when compared with those of nontransgenic cdk4/ (Fig. 2C). Analysis of p57 expression showed decreased levels in caAktTg mice (Fig. 2C).
SEN:10021522	16443763	As shown in Fig. 2A, a significant increase in Foxo1 phosphorylation at Ser256 specifically seen in slower migrating bands was obtained in islet lysates from caAktTg/cdk4/ mice.
SEN:10021526	16443763	Mice overexpressing constitutively active Akt1 in -cells (caAktTg) are in C57/B6 background and have been described previously (13). Low levels of phospho-Ser9 GSK3 staining were observed in nontransgenic cdk4/ mice (Fig. 1A). In contrast, islets from caAktTg mice exhibited striking immunostaining for phospho- Ser9 GSK3 (Fig. 1A).
SEN:10021528	20038814	We first investigated whether hyperactive mTOR could cause abnormal Notch signaling by monitoring the levels of Hes1, a direct target of Notch. We found that Hes1 protein expression was dramatically elevated in cells with constitutively active mTOR caused by loss of the Tsc2 or Pten tumor suppressor gene or oncogenic myristoylation of AKT1 (myrAKT1) (34) (Figure 2A).
SEN:10021532	16982679	The reduced level of p53 protein in myr-Akt1 salivary glands corresponds with an increase in MDM2 phosphorylation in vivo, suggesting that the Akt/MDM2/p53 pathway is responsible for suppression of apoptosis. Dominant-negative Akt blocked phosphorylation of MDM2 in salivary acinar cells from myr-Akt1 transgenic mice.
SEN:10021534	20038814	Both TA-p63 and deltaN-p63 were overexpressed in cells with mTOR activation because of either a lack of Tsc2 or Pten or expression of AKT1-E17K, and were repressed by rapamycin
SEN:10021536	11861503	Heterologous expression of Akt1/PKB(alpha) potently suppressed MCK gene transcription without affecting myogenin gene transcription, whereas heterologous expression of Akt2 increased myogenin and MCK gene transcription.
SEN:10021538	20038814	upregulation of Jagged1 by mTOR was due, at least in part, to higher levels of Jagged1 mRNA in the Tsc2-null and mutant AKT-expressing cell lines (Figure 3B) and appeared to be directly responsible for Notch activation and Hes1 expression, as these were blocked by decreased Jagged1 expression using siRNA (Figure 3C).
SEN:10021546	15109499	we show that in cultured myotubes undergoing atrophy, the activity of the PI3K/AKT pathway decreases, leading to activation of Foxo transcription factors and atrogin-1 induction.
SEN:10021552	18955973	Furthermore, inhibition of ATM/ATR kinases abolishes both induction of Rad51 and phosphorylation of p53 and reduced the level of apoptosis induced by coexpression of oncogenes and ARF (Pauklin et al., 2005).
SEN:10021560	14990569	We propose that BRCA1 phosphorylation by Aurora-A plays a role in G(2) to M transition of cell cycle.
SEN:10021562	19023129	Point-mutation and in vitro kinase analyses showed that PPARgamma was phosphorylated by Bcr at serine 82.
SEN:10021564	19023129	Overexpression of wild-type Bcr kinase did not inhibit ligand-mediated PPARgamma1 S82A mutant transcriptional activity, indicating that Bcr regulates PPARgamma activity via S82 phosphorylation.
SEN:10021570	8621729	Similar observation that immunoprecipitated B-Raf from EGF-stimulated Swiss3T3 cells could activate both MEK1 and MEK2 was also obtained (data not shown).
SEN:10021574	10852954	We also examined the effect of terreic acid, a specific inhibitor of Btk (35), on PKCs in mast cells. Terreic acid inhibited the autophosphorylating activity of PKCbI ...

PGC-1 binds to various transcription factors to maximize transcriptional activity, and leads to up-regulation of mitochondrial enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism and electron transport, as well as mitochondrial DNA replication
SEN:10021582	15262994	Specifically, Cn and CaMK have been shown to activate PGC-1a gene transcription through myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) and cAMP response element binding protein (12). in transgenic mice skeletal muscle specific overexpression of Cn* or CaMK* results in increased expression of PGC-1a (7,13).
SEN:10021588	9192873	We show that expression of cyclin E-CDK2 in murine fibroblasts causes phosphorylation of the CDK inhibitor p27Kip1 on T187, and that cyclin E-CDK2 can directly phosphorylate p27 T187 in vitro.
SEN:10021594	8995365	In contrast, ectopic expression of cyclin A or cyclin E inhibits MCK expression only when they are co-expressed with their catalytic partner cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2).
SEN:10021608	12084709	Pctaire1 can be phosphorylated by the Cdk5/p25 complex, and serine 95 is the major phosphorylation site. In brain and muscle of Cdk5 null mice, Pctaire1 activity is significantly reduced Pctaire1 interacts with p35, both in vitro and in vivo, and that phosphorylation of Pctaire1 by Cdk5 enhances its kinase activity.
SEN:10021610	10859164	CHK1 heterozygosity modestly enhances the tumorigenesis phenotype of WNT-1 transgenic mice. Chk1 plays an essential role in the mammalian DNA damage checkpoint, embryonic development, and tumor suppression
SEN:10021614	10553070	This finding agrees with previous studies that showed that IkBa is a better substrate for the IKKs than IkBb (17). The kinetics of IkBa and IkBb phosphorylation were coincident with the degradation of endogenous IkBa as well as the appearance of DNA-binding NF-kB complexes in the nucleus at approximately 15–30 min (Fig. 1B, bottom three panels).
SEN:10021620	1334250	A novel protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) substrate, p120, has been previously implicated in ligand-induced signaling through the epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor and colony-stimulating factor 1 receptors

SEN:10021630	1856214	These studies demonstrate that exogenous CK II and a ribosome-bound, CK II-like enzyme phosphorylate the ribosomal P proteins in vitro and localize the target site for phosphorylation to the COOH terminus.
SEN:10021638	18268536	observations that inhibition of PI3K or EGF-R is sufficient to prevent terminal differentiation in keratinocytes in suspension (Rodeck et al., 1997; Nikolopoulos et al., 2005), and that function disrupting antibodies to E-cadherin abrogate Akt phosphorylation inducing growth arrest and terminal differentiation in conventional submerged mouse keratinocyte cultures at confluency (Calautti et al., 2005).
SEN:10021644	11684709	EGF-R causes disassembly of hemidesmosomes by activating Fyn, which in turn phosphorylates the beta4 cytoplasmic domain. Neoplastic cells expressing dominant negative Fyn display increased hemidesmosomes and migrate poorly in vitro in response to EGF.
SEN:10021650	9365239	Eps8 protein, which contains an SH3 domain, is coupled functionally and physically to the EGFR and is tyrosine phosphorylated by this receptor
SEN:10021652	11457715	The EGF effect depended on activation of its receptor tyrosine kinase but not on that of protein kinase C, mitogen-activated protein kinases, or phosphoinositide-3 kinase.
SEN:10021654	20153347	As shown in Figs. 6B and C, acrolein induced 5-LO expression was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by pretreatment with AG1478...These results indicate that acrolein increased 5-LO expression through activation of the EGFR pathway.
SEN:10021658	15292206	Experiments in primary mammary epithelial cells and transfected COS-7 cells revealed a p44/42 MAPK and EGFR-dependent Stat3 activation.
SEN:10021660	18268536	In vivo, b4-integrin amplifies proproliferative signals in basal epidermal keratinocytes (Nikolopoulos et al., 2005), where STAT3 is expressed and can be activated by EGF/EGF-R (Nishio et al., 2001; Chan et al., 2004; Li et al., 2007)
SEN:10021662	11350938	since in PKR-null MEFs there is a marked defect in Erk1 and Erk2 activation by PDGF (Figure1D), it appears that PKR is involved in serine phosphorylation of Stat3 through the activation of Erks.
SEN:10021664	11350938	Whereas PKR+/+ cells exhibited a clear induction in phospho-Ser727 Stat3, PKR-null cells were defective in this process (Figure1B)
SEN:10021666	11350938	Accordingly, nuclear extracts prepared from PDGF-treated PKR- null cells were severely deficient in Stat3 containing DNA-binding complexes compared with wild-type MEFs (data not shown). Taken together, we conclude that PDGF-induced activation of Stat3 DNA binding is PKR dependent.
SEN:10021668	12588811	The extensive beta-cell death in PERK-/- islets appears to be caused by the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER, as suggested by abnormal ER morphology in PERK-/- cells (10).
SEN:10021674	12588811	Inactivation of PERK resulted in a dramatic decrease in the phosphorylated form of eIF-2alpha in the pancreas (13).
SEN:10021676	12588811	Phosphorylation of eIF2alpha results in inhibition of general protein synthesis ( ) and selective activation of ATF4 transcription that up-regulates CHOP gene expression, which in turn causes islet beta-cell apoptosis.

SEN:10021692	10896947	FGF-2 (>/=10(-12) m) also increased cathepsin K and MMP-9 mRNA levels in mouse and rabbit osteoclasts. Among FGF receptors (FGFR1 to 4) only FGFR1 was detected on isolated mouse osteoclasts, whereas all FGFRs were identified on mouse osteoblasts.
SEN:10021696	12203718	Immunolocalization of FGFR2 and FGFR3 revealed overlap with Dach1 expression during skeletal patterning and chondrocyte maturation. We conclude that Dach1 is a target gene of FGF signaling during limb skeletal development, and Dach1 may function as an intermediary in the FGF signaling pathway regulating cell proliferation or differentiation.
SEN:10021698	15897591	On the other hand, FRS2 expression seemed to be up-regulated slightly in the FGF8-stimulated cells

SEN:10023788	10194465	Recently, b1 integrins have also been reported to enhance IRS-1 phosphorylation and interaction, but not glucose transport, with downstream molecules such as PI3-kinase and Akt (74). These results suggest that integrins and insulin/IGF-1 receptor signaling pathways converge at an early point in the signaling cascade around the IRS proteins.
SEN:10023796	11337499	As JunD/ eb1 homodimers are strong stimulators of TIMP-1 gene transcription, the most likely explanation for the inhibitory effects of exogenously added Fra2 and FosB is that they form heterodimers with endogenous JunD that are less active than JunD homodimers.

SEN:10024536	10362713	TNF-a significantly increased the production of IL-6 in WI-38-40 cells. However, DMSO was not able to inhibit the TNF-a-induced IL-6 enhancement in both protein and mRNA levels (Fig. 7).

SEN:10024618	10080909	It has been difficult to interpret the physiologic role of STAT signaling in megakaryocyte development. In multiple cell lines it was reported that TPO induced activation of both STAT3 and STAT5 (5A and 5B) (26, 28?30, 37, 38)....However, when purified murine megakaryocyte extracts were examined, we found that STAT3 was much more pronounced in both tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity than STAT5 (32)

SEN:10024684	10973960	To clarify the mechanism by which WT1 represses the CTGF promoter, we were interested in identifying sequences within the promoter that are recognized by WT1.
SEN:10024688	11278460	Our hypothesis is that because mutation of both genes causes sex reversal in humans and WT1 is expressed before SRY in the gonadal ridge, WT1 may regulate the expression of SRY.
SEN:10024690	10362713	As shown in Fig. 3A, stimulation with XO resulted in a significant increase in the levels of IL-6 at 12 and 24 h compared with those with 0.7 mM X alone (P , 0.0001). Consistent with these protein data, stimulation of HS-24 cells with XO caused the maximum elevation in IL-6 mRNAlevels at 6 h, whereas XO did not modulate control GAPDH transcript levels (Fig. 3B).

SEN:10024730	10446041	The FAK and Shc pathways are regulated both positively and negatively by tyrosine phosphatases. Integrin-mediated activation of ERK is suppressed in cells that lack the re- ceptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase a or the cytosolic phosphatase SHP-2 (19). These enzymes dephosphorylate the negative regulatory site in Src-family kinases and thus, presumably, amplify both FAK and Shc signaling.

SEN:10024912	12897202	PEG-ADA therapy did, however, cause a modest decrease in mucin secretion into BAL fluid as assessed by immunoblot analysis (Figure 10).
SEN:10024916	16936205	One of the mechanisms through which adiponectin exerts such effects involves an increase in fatty acid oxidation in muscle and liver.
SEN:10024924	14683455	In muscle and liver, adiponectin activated AMP kinase and PPARalpha pathways thereby increasing beta-oxidation of lipids, leading to decreased TG content, which ameliorated insulin resistance under a high-fat diet.
SEN:10024926	18555587	gAd induced the phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 in RAW264 cells. In addition, the gAd-induced phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 was dramatically reduced by PD98059 and U0126, respectively.

SEN:10024976	21115475	We detected two-fold higher catecholamine plasma levels in Ahr-/- mice than in wild type animals (Fig. 3A,B). These levels were, however, significantly lower than those found in the plasma of Vav3-deficient mice (Fig. 3A,B).
SEN:10024984	19158396	As shown in Figure 6A, the kinetic of EGTA-dependent detachment was much slower in T-FGM AhR-/- cells than in their wild-type counterparts. Similar results were obtained when AhR-/- and AhR-/- MEFs were compared, although, similarly to the cell spreading experiments, the differences with respect to wild-type cells were less pronounced than in the case of the immortalized T-FGM cell line (Figure 6B).
SEN:10024988	19158396	We have shown previously that immortalized mouse fibroblasts lacking AhR expression (T-FGM AhR-/- cells) had impaired migration rates (Mulero-Navarro et al., 2005).
SEN:10024992	19158396	However, pull-down assays using a PAK-CRIB-GST fusion protein revealed that T-FGM AhR-/- cells had reduced levels of activated GTP-Rac1 compared with wildtype T-FGM fibroblasts (Figure 7A, left).
SEN:10024994	19158396	These experiments showed that T-FGM AhR-/- did have higher levels of GTP-bound RhoA than the wild-type cells (Figure 7A, right), indicating that the former cell line has higher levels of RhoA activity than the latter one.

SEN:10025030	12353028	Harlequin (Hq) mutant mice have progressive degeneration of terminally differentiated cerebellar and retinal neurons. We have identified the Hq mutation as a proviral insertion in the apoptosis-inducing factor (Aif) gene, causing about an 80% reduction in AIF expression. Mutant cerebellar granule cells are susceptible to exogenous and endogenous peroxide-mediated apoptosis, but can be rescued by AIF expression.
SEN:10025032	11259394	Overexpression of a mutant AIF protein in which the MLS has been deleted (AIF Delta 1-100) results in the primary cytosolic accumulation of AIF. AIF Delta 1-100-induced cell death is suppressed by neither Z-VAD.fmk or by Bcl-2. Thus, extramitochondrially targeted AIF is a dominant cell death inducer.
SEN:10025036	12353028	AIF is a mitochondrial oxidoreductase that translocates to the nucleus leading to nuclear condensation and apoptosis18. In addition to its role in inducing apoptosis, AIF has a potent redox function in vitro, which is separable from its apoptogenic activity20.

SEN:10025052	12562761	Expression levels of MyoD and Myf5 strongly correlate with the fast muscle phenotype (35, 36), while myogenin has been shown to be associated with the slow muscle phenotype (37). In fast-twitch gastrocnemius muscles lacking AK1 the MYF5 transcript level was increased by more than 200%
SEN:10025054	12562761	Whereas signals of myogenin transcripts could not be reliably detected, the MyoD mRNA level tended to be up-regulated (73% with low significance p < 0.09; n = 4).

SEN:10025452	18697935	As might be predicted, ectopic expression of human cIAP2 rescued TNFa-mediated IkBa degradation, whereas ectopic expression of XIAP did not (Fig. 3C). These data demonstrate that cIAP2 is required for proper TNFa-induced NF-kB signal transduction in MEFs
SEN:10025456	12387741	Here we identified BLNK as a direct target of the transcription factor Pax5 (BSAP). Restoration of BLNK expression in Ig(mu) transgenic Pax5(--) pro-B cells resulted in constitutive pre-BCR signaling and increased cell proliferation without inducing progression to the pre-B cell stage.....Pax5 Activates BLNK by Binding to the Transcription Initiation Region
SEN:10025458	15270728	By contrast, phospholipase C-gamma2 (PLC-gamma2) phosphorylation and an increase in intracellular Ca(2+) level mediated by pre-BCR cross-linking were observed only in the BLNK-expressing cells, indicating that BLNK is essential for PLC-gamma2-induced Ca(2+) influx.
SEN:10025462	21383691	Indeed, mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient for the polycomb group protein BMI1 underwent premature cellular senescence, due to the derepression of both the INK4A and ARF genes (Jacobs et al., 1999).

SEN:10025542	17299132	Papillary adenomas (1.2.1.2.2) were detected 6–8 wk after BRafVE expression and appeared to increase in number and size. These lesions were bronchiolocentric, but did not appear to involve the terminal bronchioles. Rather, the lesions appeared to arise in alveolar ducts and expand outward and around bronchioles (Fig. 4B).
SEN:10025544	17299132	At early times after induced BRafVE expression, we detected evidence of epithelial hyperplasia (classified as 1.1.1.1) arising within the terminal bronchioles and within the central lung parenchyma.

SEN:10025556	18285820	BRCA2 functions in the loading of the HR protein RAD51 during filament formation. It directly binds to RAD51 and its phosphorylation on Ser3291 inhibits this binding (Esashi et al, 2005).
SEN:10025570	16371463	Consistent with the increases in inflammatory cells in the BAL fluids from btk-/- mice, BAL fluids from these mice contained increased levels of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 (Fig. 7C). Interestingly, btk -/- BAL fluids also had higher levels of IFN-G, in line with the increased IgG2a levels in these mice (Fig. 7A).
SEN:10025572	16371463	Production of both Th1 (IFN-G) and Th2 (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) cytokines was antigen-dependent and more abundant in cultures with btk -/- DCs than in those with WT DCs (Fig. 4B ).
SEN:10025574	9590289	Of the C1qa-/- mice, 25% had glomerulonephritis with immune deposits and multiple apoptotic cell bodies. Among mice without glomerulonephritis, there were significantly greater numbers of glomerular apoptotic bodies in C1q-deficient mice compared with controls.

(Western Blot)
SEN:10025622	16670335	Caspase-11, which is needed for the activation of procaspase-1 and pro-IL-1, was induced by LPS treatment in the lung and primary cultured macrophages. The induction of caspase-11 by LPS was suppressed in Chop knockout mice.

SEN:10025660	14607781	A more thorough analysis of Cav-1 null mice revealed that, whereas a caveolin-1 deficiency did not lead to an overt diabetic phenotype, it did result in abnormalities in lipid homeostasis, characterized by resistance to diet induced obesity, ablation of the hypodermal fat layer, progressive white adipose tissue atrophy, and hypertrophy of brown adipose tissue (58).
SEN:10025670	18323531	Increased p38b expression was observed in cav-1-/- cells and tissue (Figure 6C and data not shown).

SEN:10025704	19759904	More interestingly, CCL19 and CCL21 have recently been involved in DC maturation, by enhancing the up-regulation of CD86 and CD40 expression markers, whereas CCL19 stimulation also led to increased secretion of IL-12, IL-1? and TNF? from DCs.
SEN:10025714	17446529	Peritoneal macrophages pre-attached to Transwell membranes were exposed to media, fMLP, GM-CSF, or MCP-1. After 21 h incubation, the concentration of migrated CD44-deficient macrophages was significantly less than that of migrated C57BL/6 macrophages under all conditions
SEN:10025734	9541500	Wounds of mice treated with anti-MIP-1alpha antiserum had significantly fewer macrophages than control (41% decrease, P < 0. 01). This decrease in wound macrophages was paralleled by decreased angiogenic activity and collagen synthesis.

SEN:10025750	16537903	In these cells, cyclin D3 is increased during differentiation and phosphorylates C/EBPalpha at Ser193, leading to the formation of growth-inhibitory C/EBPalpha-cdk2 and C/EBPalpha-Brm complexes.
SEN:10025752	15661853	Pharmacological and genetic studies provide evidence that the expression of cyclin G1, not cyclin G2, is regulated by progesterone via its nuclear receptor. Furthermore, the expression of these genes is aberrantly up-regulated in homeo box A-10 mutant uteri, suggesting that cyclin G1 and cyclin G2 genes act as downstream targets of homeobox A-10 and negatively impact uterine cell proliferation.
SEN:10025764	11884467	levels of mRNA encoding ...C were evaluated in lungs from IL-13 transgene and transgene mice...Interestingly, the levels of expression of TIMP-1 and TIMP-4 were increased in CCR2/ animals (Fig. 7B).

SEN:10025872	12662296	Anti-CD4 was found to perturb proximal signalling events upon TCR/CD3 ligation, resulting in reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of Zap-70 and LAT (linker for activation of T cells) and reduced association of tyrosine-phosphorylated LAT with lck. This ultimately resulted in severely reduced proliferation of the responding CD4+ T cells
SEN:10025874	21697282	Api6 overexpression in lung epithelial cells only caused regional inflammation, not systemic inflammation.
SEN:10025878	21697282	At the gene transcriptional level, Api6 overexpression stimulated mRNA expression of Stat3 and its upstream stimuli IL-6 in whole lung cells, AT II epithelial cells, and alveolar macrophages (Fig. 4A).

SEN:10025890	18268536	E-cadherinknockout epidermis displays some hyperproliferation, which however appears to be limited due to compensatory upregulation of P-cadherin (Young et al., 2003; Tinkle et al., 2004; Tunggal et al., 2005)
SEN:10025892	18268536	Recently reported in A431 cells, this can occur through E-cadherin-mediated inhibition of transphosphorylation on Tyr845EGF-R (Perrais et al., 2007), the site, which catalyzes EGF-induced mitogenesis (Ishizawar and Parsons, 2004).
SEN:10025894	8799827	Furthermore, transfection of E-cadherin cDNA into invasive NM-f-ras-TD cells resulted in the upregulation of syndecan-1 expression in association with decreased invasiveness.
SEN:10025912	14570040	When Notch-IC is present, however, it competes with the inhibitory proteins to bind to CSL. Notch1-IC also directly stimulates expression of the cell-cycle regulator Waf1 (also known as Cip1 and p21) in primary mouse keratinocytes25. The increase in Waf1 concentration causes proliferating keratinocytes to withdraw from the cell cycle and helps to initiate terminal differentiation.
SEN:10025914	15225871	Increased levels of the p21 protein are also observed in other contexts of cell cycle arrest, such as differentiation and senescence.
SEN:10025916	12242286	Molecular analysis indicated that myostatin down-regulated the protein levels of Cdk2 and up-regulated the levels of its inhibitor p21, thereby rendering Cdk2 inactive.
SEN:10025918	8995365	For each of these conditions, myogenic transcriptional inhibition is reversed by the ectopic co-expression of the general Cdk inhibitor p21.

SEN:10025934	21372295	Taken together, these data indicate that PYK2-induced p21Cip1 activates p300, which promotes Ets-1 binding to the MCP-1 promoter, leading to enhancement of MCP-1 transcription.
SEN:10025936	21372295	Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of p21Cip1 (88+/-3% inhibition in p21Cip1 protein levels, n=4, P,0.05) attenuated TNFa-mediated Ets-1 binding to MCP-1 promoter in WT-EC (Figure 5D).

Note the stronger immunoreactive products of SP-A (b) and SP-C (d) over the alveolar cells in the hyperplastic alveolar wall and over materials in the alveolar spaces
SEN:10025980	10510303	Collectively, these results show that C/EBPalpha and C/EBPbeta trans-acting factors can promote transcription of the mouse p8 gene (i) by direct binding to the C/EBP consensus site, and (ii) by enhancing the activity of other trans-acting factors interacting with the p8 promoter.
SEN:10025982	12560325	Of members of the C/EBP family of transcription factors, C/EBP alpha was the strongest trans-activator of the PEPCK-C gene promoter in the NIH3T3 cell line.
SEN:10025984	11683182	Accumulation of b-actin mRNA was essentially identical in both wild-type (+/+) and knockout (-/-) lungs. The ratios of the calculated dot areas for SP-A, SP-B, and SP-C mRNAs divided by those for the b-actin mRNAs in the wild-type (+/+) and knockout (-/-) lungs were 0.16±0.04 and 0.24±0.04 (n=4, P<0.05), 0.52±0.12 and 0.79±0.09 (n=4, P<0.05), and 1.98±0.24 and 2.49±0.31 (n=4), respectively (Fig. 5).

We observed a similar rate of entrance into S phase when counting cells microinjected with a control antiserum (RAM, Figure 1e). Cells micro- injected with anti-RALT antibodies and stimulated with EGF progressed to S phase at a frequency which was 2.8-fold higher than control cells.
SEN:10026560	11457715	Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and heparin-binding (HB)-EGF, but not platelet-derived growth factor or insulin-like growth factor I, inhibited (125)I-ANP binding to ND-NOD and D-NOD mesangial cells, particularly in the latter.

Most of the radioactivity is contained in the set of partially overlapping peptides encompassing serines 383 and 389 (peptides 1- 4, 8 and 9).
SEN:10026578	18823499	As shown in Fig. 2a, EGF (100 ng/mL) increased the level of Cx43 phosphorylation from 5 min, to reach a maximum at 60 min.

SEN:10026602	12402043	When Myc-tagged mSpry2 and haemagluttinin A (HA)- tagged Grb2 were expressed in cultured cells, both molecules translocated to the ruffling membrane region in response to stimulation with FGF or EGF and colocalized there (Fig. 1c).
SEN:10026606	12556466	as long as Egr1 expression was inhibited, the proliferation rate of C2 cells was markedly reduced and then resumed as soon as Egr1 expression recovered
SEN:10026608	16439363	Egr-1 appeared to play an important role in these responses because tissue (Fig. 2A) and BAL inflammation were all significantly diminished in Tg (+) mice with null mutant Egr-1 loci (Fig. 2B).
SEN:10026614	12556466	Furthermore we also showed that Egr1 is responsible for cyclin D2overexpression in tumorigenic DU145 human prostate cells. The regulation ofthese genes by Egr1 was demonstrated using Egr1 antisense oligonucleotides thatfurther implicated Egr1 in resistance to apoptotic signals
SEN:10026618	10734128	Erg1 transcription factor directly activates the luteinizing hormone beta LHbeta subuit promoter, and female mice lacking Egr1 are infertile due to LHbeta deficiency
SEN:10026622	18223159	Reynolds et al. (137) investigated the expression of Egr-1 (early growth response gene 1) in NZW and AKR mice. Egr-1 gene induces IL-1b and TNFa, cytokines that contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells after smoke exposure.
SEN:10026624	16439363	Egr-1 did, however, play a critical role in the activation of TGF-B1 because the ability of IL-13 to activate TGF-B1 was markedly diminished in comparisons of BAL fluids from Tg (+) mice with wild type and null mutant Egr-1 loci (Fig. 8B).

SEN:10026650	11350938	The results (Figure4A and B) showed a 16-fold induction in PKR wild-type cells in contrast to a 0.8-fold induction in c-fos message in PKR-null cells at 15 min of PDGF treatment

SEN:10026706	12080085	To identify the modified residue, the relevant tryptic peptides from each sample were further analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. Comparison of the fragment patterns revealed that Asn 851 contained the additional oxygen atom (Fig. 4B). Together these data show that FIH-1 is an asparaginyl hydroxylase that inhibits HIF transcriptional activity by preventing CAD association with the coactivator p300.

SEN:10026758	17452443	The reduction in Ero1-L{alpha} expression had no significant effect on synthesis of adiponectin or actin or secretion of adipsin, but it did significantly reduce the amount of adiponectin secreted from the cells (Fig. 7, compare lanes 1 to 3 with lane 4).
SEN:10026760	15592500	This reduction in Ero1-La led to a significant reduction in the constitutive amount of VEGF secreted to the medium (Figure 6b).

These studies thus define a novel metabolic pathway that links ER stress to skeletal muscle integrity and function.
SEN:10027312	15225871	As depicted in Fig. 1, several observations indicated that HBP1 could be part of proliferation barriers with shared functional similarity to RB in differentiation and in G1 control.

SEN:10027838	19601851	IL-10-deficient mice fed an atherogenic diet exhibit a significant increase in lipid accumulation and demonstrate increased lesions compared with wild-type mice [78, 79].
SEN:10027850	16940042	Thus, while IL-10 can reduce Th2 recall immune responses, its major effect evident during the primary response is to inhibit the development of Th1 responses, thereby favoring Th2 development.
SEN:10027854	11591769	IL-10 can directly promote the death of inflammatory cells, including activated macrophages (4), neutrophils (5), and T cells
SEN:10027856	16293001	Pinderski and colleagues have recently reported that a reduction in macrophage caspase3 activity in LDL-receptor null mice overexpressing IL10 most likely accounts for the decreased formation of necrotic cores within the atherosclerotic lesions of these animals, suggesting antiapoptotic and plaque-stabilizing effects of IL10 (114)
SEN:10027860	18666314	from full text - An inactivation of IL-10 in mice results in an increased production of IL-12 and IFN-gamma [42,43]. Inflamed tissues and granulomas of CD show low IL-10[44]. Melgar et al[45] reported a highly significant increase in IL-10 mRNA levels in T lymphocytes and in IL-10-positive cells in the colons of UC patients.
SEN:10027864	17332883	Although some studies suggest that IL-10 (alone or in combination with IFN-g) also functions as a repressor of the fibrotic process (97), the role of IL-10 in SSc remains to be clarified.
SEN:10027874	16037570	Pretreatment of the cells with IL-10 resulted in a marked reduction of Elk-1 phosphorylation (Figure 6A).

SEN:10027878	12393603	Overall, these results show that, in mice, GC treatment and IL-10 overproduction both stimulate GILZ production in vivo
SEN:10027880	11591769	In contrast, IL-10 increases the survival of some types of human cancer cells, such as Burkitt lymphoma (7). Non-Hodgkin s lymphoma cells secrete IL-10, and inhibition of this autocrine IL-10 has recently been shown to promote cell death and reduce expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2
SEN:10027882	11591769	Similarly, IL-10 increases the expression of Bcl-xL in thyrocytes from patients with Graves disease

SEN:10027906	11157054	it appears that induction of IL-12, at least as assessed in BAL fluid, is induced to a level that overcomes any antagonistic action of endogenous IL-12 p40 (Fig. 2).
SEN:10027910	12897202	By 3 months of age, adenosine concentrations in lungs from IL-13 Tg mice had increased to levels tenfold greater than those measured in wild-type lungs.
SEN:10027912	11884467	IL-13 caused an impressive increase in lung collagen (measured by hydroxyproline content assay) and BAL HA content that could be easily appreciated with the histochemical and biochemical measurement techniques (Fig. 5 and data not shown).
SEN:10027916	11884467	In the CC10-IL-13 mice, progressive lung pathology is noted. At 1 mo of age, these animals manifest peribronchial inflammation, mucus metaplasia, alveolar enlargement, and subepithelial fibrosis (10).

SEN:10027926	12091879	In animal models of allergic asthma, blockade of IL-13 markedly inhibits allergen-induced AHR, mucus production and eosinophilia. Furthermore, IL-13 delivery to the airway causes all of these effects. IL-13 is thus both necessary and sufficient for experimental models of asthma.
SEN:10027930	12091879	As expected, we found that tg-IL-13+Stat6+/- mice had substantial fibrosis as demonstrated by elevated levels of lung hydroxyproline, a constituent of collagen (Fig. 3b). This increase was dependent on STAT6 expression, but expression of hSTAT6 in epithelial cells did not result in reconstitution of the fibrotic response.
SEN:10027932	16849505	As previously reported (11), Tg IL-13 was a potent stimulator of fibrosis in Tg mice with (/) 5-LO loci (Fig. 6, A and B).
SEN:10027936	12897202	The A3 adenosine receptor was expressed diffusely in the lungs of wild-type mice (Figure 6a). In lungs from IL-13 Tg mice this receptor was expressed diffusely in the interstitium (data not shown) and in patches of inflammatory cells that encompassed eosinophils and macrophages near sites of remodeling (Figure 6b).
SEN:10027938	10072486	Among the Th2 cytokines tested, IL-13 was by far the most effective cytokine inducing eotaxin in the lung, up-regulating both the eotaxin mRNA expression and protein production (Fig. 2, A–C).
SEN:10027940	10072486	naive BALB/c mice were treated with different concentrations of IL-4 and IL-13, and eotaxin in lung tissues or in BAL were measured by ELISA...Compared with IL-13, IL-4 induced much lower levels of eotaxin even at higher doses (Fig. 4).
SEN:10027942	11884467	MCP-3, macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC), and C10 have also been demonstrated to be induced in an IL-13-dependent fashion in vivo, and IL-13 stimulates MCP-1, MDC, and eotaxin production in vitro (14, 26, 27).
SEN:10027944	11884467	Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that IL-13 is a potent stimulator of eotaxin production in vivo (10).
SEN:10027946	11884467	This was done by quantitating the levels of selected chemokines (MCP-1, MIP-1, eotaxin) in BAL...fluids from CC10-rtTA-IL-13 mice at intervals after dox administration. Rapid inductive patterns and delayed inductive patterns were noted.
SEN:10027948	16951379	IL-13 increased Egr-1 mRNA levels in a biphasic manner in Stat6/ fibroblasts; early induction of Egr-1 mRNA was observed 30 min following exposure to IL-13 and declined after 3–6 h (Fig. 6A). Egr-1 protein was increased in Stat6/ fibroblasts as compared with Stat6/ fibroblasts from 30 min to 3 h after IL-13 treatment (Fig. 6, B and C).

SEN:10027976	12897202	transcripts for the the A2A adenosine receptor were decreased in the lungs of 3-month-old IL-13 Tg mice, whereas transcripts for the A1, A2B, and A3 adenosine receptors were elevated (Figure 3a).
SEN:10027978	12897202	In the IL-13 Tg mice A2B transcripts were found in inflammatory cells, likely macrophages, located within the enlarged alveolar alveolar spaces and in bronchial epithelium and walls of pulmonary blood vessels (Figures 5, b and c).
SEN:10027980	16849505	In addition, as shown in Fig. 1, IL-13 caused a significant increase in the amounts of mRNA encoding cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) (Fig. 1A) and lesser increases in LTA4 hydrolase (LTA4H) and 5-LO-activating protein (FLAP) (Fig. 1B). (In Tg IL-13 lung specific overexpression mouse model)
SEN:10027982	11884467	we assessed the levels of mRNA encoding CC chemokines that might be expected to contribute to these responses. As shown in Fig. 1A, IL-13 was a potent stimulator of MCP moieties, including MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, and MCP-5 (Fig. 1).
SEN:10027986	11694454	As expected (Figure 4), IL-9 induced the expression of mCLCA3, confirming the observation in IL-9 transgenic mice. In addition, IL-4 and IL-13 were also able to induce the expression of mCLCA3 in the lung, whereas no expression was observed in the lungs of mice treated with IFN-gamma (Figure 4).
SEN:10027988	16374521	Tg IL-13 caused increases in lung volume, alveolar size, goblet cell number, and Gob-5, Muc-5ac, and Muc-1 gene expression in Tg+ ERK1/2 MAPK-sufficient animals (Figure 8, A–H).

SEN:10028008	11067861	Interestingly, IL-13 did cause an approximately 80% decrease in pulmonary a1-AT expression (Figure 13). It also caused a significant increase in TIMP-1 expression that was seen after as little as 1 day and was readily apparent with longer periods of dox administration (Figure 13, and data not shown) (P < 0.05 for all comparisons).
SEN:10028010	11884467	As previously reported (13), IL-13 was a potent inducer of TIMP-1 and had lesser stimulatory effects on TIMP-2 and TIMP-4 while inhibiting 1-AT in wild-type animals (Fig. 7B). (RT-PCR analysis)

SEN:10028154	12540842	Because STAP-2 expression is induced by proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 or IL-1beta, STAP-2 may play a role in the regulation of inflammation.
SEN:10028156	17105652	Real-time RT-PCR revealed that IL-1beta induced SYN expression at the transcriptional level, because the mRNA level of SYN was upregulated by IL-1?. TNF-? had a weaker effect on SYN transcription, whereas IL-6 had no effect
SEN:10028158	17317723	We also observed that IL-1, a major proinflammatory cytokine that increases in smokers and plays a key role in atherosclerosis (1, 2, 23, 24), produced -catenin translocation to the nucleus after 30 min (Fig. 1A, C).

SEN:10028244	18955973	Following IL-3 withdrawal, c-MYC is downregulated and cells become growth arrested, accumulating in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, and rapidly undergo apoptosis. Enforced c-MYC expression accelerates the apoptotic response in the absence of IL-3 (Askew et al., 1991).
SEN:10028252	16585210	In parental Ba/F3 cells, PIM-1 mRNA expression was strictly dependent on IL-3 stimulation and decreased rapidly after IL-3 depletion.

SEN:10028258	11397944	In addition to their positive effects on TH2 and TH1 development, IL-4 (Fig. 1) and IL-12 (7, 30), acting via STAT proteins, potently suppress induction of T-bet and Gata-3, thereby limiting differentiation of TH1 and TH2 subsets, respectively.
SEN:10028260	10783130	IL-4 increases mRNA turnover of IL-1 b and TNFa in human monocytes and mouse macrophages, respectively (23, 24).
SEN:10028266	12626590	In addition to its effects on human cells, IL-4 reduced C5a receptors in murine bone marrow-derived DC and impaired recruitment of labeled bone marrow-derived DC in syngeneic BALB/c mice to i.p. injected C5a. Overall, these data suggest that inhibition of a rapid anaphylatoxin-induced mobilization of monocytes and DC to inflamed tissues represents an important anti-inflammatory activity of the Th2 cytokine IL-4.
SEN:10028268	11397944	Induction of IFN-g was clearly STAT4-independent, consistent with prior in vitro (10) and in vivo (15) findings, and, as expected (16), emergence of IFN-g expressing cells was markedly limited by IL-4 signaling. Combinations of neutralizing antibodies and cytokines further confirmed the specificity of these pathways (17).
SEN:10028276	16547273	To verify the absence of the STAT6-signaling cascade in STAT6-/- MLF, we assessed mOSM and mIL-4 induced responses with respect to STAT3 and STAT6 activation. Fig. 6 confirms the absence of STAT6 protein and STAT6 induction in STAT6-/- MLF but equivalent activation of STAT3 in both wt and STAT6-/- MLF.
SEN:10028280	11397944	Induction of T-bet was, however, suppressed by IL-4 (Fig. 1D) acting via STAT6 (17). Thus, T-bet expression and TH1 differentiation are coordinately induced without requiring IL-12/STAT4 and are coordinately suppressed by IL-4/STAT6.

Interestingly, the major difference appears to be that expression of KRasG12D in the lung leads to more rapid and consistent progression to adenocarcinoma than that elicited by BRafVE.
SEN:10028764	15284181	Constitutively active mutant K-ras(V12) in E10 cells led to a highly significant (P < 0.001) increased level of peroxides, and a corresponding increase in the amount of DNA strand-break damage, compared with the parental line E10 and the vector control
SEN:10028766	17468755	Expression of KrasG12V induced also a loss of epithelial markers (as assessed by E-cadherin staining, which was similar in Mapk14D/+ and Mapk14D/D alveoli; Fig. 6c) and an increase in SP-C+ cells (Fig. 6d).

SEN:10028836	15579447	In addition, we obtained cells from the lungs and the spleen from the OVA-challenged mice and cultured them in the presence of OVA. We noted that cells from gal3-/- mice produced significantly higher amounts of IFN-g (a Th1 cytokine) and lower amounts of IL-4 (a Th2 cytokine), compared to gal3+/+ mice (data not shown). The results suggest that gal3-/- mice have lower Th2 but higher Th1 responses compared to gal3+/+ mice.

Galectin-9-induced intracellular calcium flux, aggregation and death of T(H)1 cells were Tim-3-dependent in vitro, and administration of galectin-9 in vivo resulted in selective loss of interferon-gamma-producing cells and suppression of T(H)1 autoimmunity.
SEN:10028858	16286920	According to our confocal image data, there were apoptotic bodies and necrotic-like cells present during galectin-9-induced cell death, suggesting the possible involvement of apoptotic and necrotic cell death. Similarly, galectin-2 can induce both necrosis and apoptosis23.

SEN:10028914	19742316	About a two-fold increase of PDGFRb expression was detected in smLRP1-/- mice regardless of LDLR genotype (Figure 2A, C). Increased Erk1/2 phosphorylation was also observed in these aortas (Figure 2A). These data suggest that the expression and activation of PDGFRb is only regulated by LRP1, not LDLR.
SEN:10028918	19742316	Studies from our laboratory have shown that LRP1 suppresses PDGF receptor b (PDGFRb) activation and protects against atherosclerosis.

SEN:10028966	16339523	Our data show that mRNA coding for at least one transcription factor, the cytoplasmic NF-AT (NF-ATC, also known as NFATC1 and NFAT2) is induced 3-fold more in Lyn–/– BMMCs than in WT BMMCs (Table II).
SEN:10028968	16339523	The 33-fold up-regulation of sphingosine kinase 1 in Ag-stimulated Lyn–/– BMMCs may also contribute to increased chemokine production
SEN:10028972	12642482	At the 35-somite stage, there were few TUNEL-positive cells but, significantly, they were observed in the Mab21l1-/- lens placode (Fig. 6I,J). We did not see significant differences at either the 32- or 40-somite stages (data not shown). These results suggest that Mab21l1 is required for lens placode cell proliferation and for protection against apoptosis.
SEN:10028974	12642482	These results suggest that MAB21L1 function is required for the appropriate induction and subsequent maintenance of Foxe3 expression.
SEN:10028980	17158225	Given our observation that overexpression of MafB inhibits RANKL-mediated osteoclast differentiation, we examined the expression levels of NFATc1 and OSCAR, which are known to be important modulators of osteoclastogenesis.11,32 As compared to control, exogenous overexpression of MafB attenuated the expression of NFATc1 as well as OSCAR during RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis (Figure 3A).

SEN:10028990	21628326	LC3-II was increased in FoxO3MyHC cardiomyocytes after ex vivo transgene activation (Figure 4F; see Supplementary material online, Figure S6C). Treatment with lysosomal inhibitors revealed that LC3-II levels could still be stimulated in FoxO3MyHC cardiomyocytes, indicating an activation of autophagy rather than a disturbance in autophagic flux.
SEN:10028992	21151103	Compared to wild-type Map1lc3b+/+ macrophages, Map1lc3b-/- macrophages displayed a higher level of the active, cleaved (10 kDa) form of caspase-1 in response to LPS and ATP treatment (Fig. 1a).

SEN:10029004	15039780	Moreover, genetic inactivation of MKK4 in MEFs resulted in reduced proliferation doubling times and premature senescence, indicating that both MKK4 and MKK7 are essential for these cellular processes (data not shown).
SEN:10029010	15039780	In contrast, proliferation of hepatocytes was markedly impaired in E11.5 mkk7-/- embryos, as determined by BrdU in vivo labelling (data not shown).
SEN:10029012	15039780	Re-expression of wild-type MKK7 (Fig. 2c) restored the reduced proliferation of mkk7- /- MEFs to levels observed in wild-type MEFs.

SEN:10029016	15039780	Importantly, cyclin B1-associated CDC2 kinase activity was markedly reduced in mkk7-/- MEFs (Fig. 4d), indicating that reduced CDC2 expression correlates with impaired cyclin B1/CDC2 activity.
SEN:10029022	15039780	Similarly to mkk7-/- MEFs, cdc2 mRNA expression was downregulated in primary mkk7-/- hepatocytes (Fig. 4g).

SEN:10029060	17468755	However, the SP-C+ cells were more numerous in the Mapk14-/- lungs (with almost twice as many as in Mapk14-/+ lungs; Fig. 2c). Notably, immunohistological staining showed reduced levels of the epithelial marker E-cadherin in the alveolar cells (Fig. 2c), indicating defective differentiation of these cells.
SEN:10029062	17468755	Notably, we found that p38a-deficient lungs contained lower levels of C/EBPa and HNF3b, another transcription factor involved in lung differentiation whose expression is controlled by C/EBPa (ref. 19) (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 1a online).
SEN:10029064	19454702	As demonstrated in Fig. 8A, ERK was strongly phosphorylated in p38–/– MEF, but not in p38+/+ MEF.
SEN:10029066	17468755	Furthermore, the higher number of AT2 cells correlated with an almost fivefold increase in Ki67+ cells in Mapk14-/- lungs compared with the number of Ki67+ cells in their heterozygous Mapk14D/+ counterparts (Fig. 2d).

SEN:10029072	17468755	three times as much Egfr mRNA was present in Mapk14D/D lungs (Fig. 3d) compared with Mapk14D/+ lungs, suggesting that EGFR expression was transcriptionally enhanced in the absence of p38a.

SEN:10029080	19454702	Nrf2 levels were higher in nuclear fractions of p38–/– MEF compared with those in p38+/+ MEF and Nrf2 was hardly detectable in the cytoplasmic fractions (Fig. 5). However, only minor differences were observed for total Nrf2 levels
SEN:10029082	17468755	Notably, EGFR transcription is regulated by AP-1 (ref. 28), and we observed higher levels of phospho-c-Jun, one of the AP-1 components, in the p38a-deficient lungs (Fig. 3c), suggesting that p38a downregulation might activate AP-1.
SEN:10029098	15039780	These results are consistent with previous data showing that loss of JNK1/JNK2 in MEFs results in reduced proliferation17 and that inactivation of c-Jun in MEFs results in premature senescence and impaired proliferation19.

SEN:10029186	16272275	Treatment of a strain of mice, which spontaneously develop atherosclerotic lesions (apolipoprotein E-deficient mice) with neutralizing anti-MIF Ab, led to a reduction of a variety of inflammatory mediators typically associated with atherosclerosis (32), implying that MIF may also play an important role in arterial intima inflammation.
SEN:10029188	18385967	In MIF?/? mice, endotoxin-treated macrophages showed decreased viability, reduced proinflammatory function, and increased apoptosis [37].
SEN:10029204	18791328	Use of antisense MIF led to decreased MIF concentrations in treated macrophages while higher amounts of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase and lower concentrations of cytokines such as TNF were observed. This study thus demonstrated the proinflammatory potential of MIF and stressed the importance of an autocrine action of MIF to override steroid-induced MKP-1 and to inhibit cytokine production [29] .

SEN:10029300	12242286	INTRO Myostatin is a newly identified member of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily, and myostatin-null mice have been found to show a two- to threefold increase in skeletal muscle mass due to an increase in the number of muscle fibers (hyperplasia) and the size of the fibers (hypertrophy) (21).
SEN:10029308	12673834	MT-I overexpression regulated the inflammatory response, decreased oxidative stress and apoptosis significantly, and increased brain tissue repair in comparison with either GFAP-IL-6 or control litter-mate mice.
SEN:10029316	20038814	While the reduction of mTOR markedly abolished STAT3, p63, and Notch signaling (Figure 9A), decreased expression of rictor did not affect the STAT3/p63/Notch signaling cascade (Figure 9B).
SEN:10029318	19390566	Furthermore, the inactivation of mTOR decreases IL-2 secretion upon stimulation of DCs through the C-type lectin receptor Dectin [138], indicating that cytokine production through C-type lectin receptor activation involves mTOR.

SEN:10029384	19293939	By using neutralizing antibody against TLR4, the releases of CCL3 and CXCL2 was decreased (Fig. 3A and B). MyD88 is a critical adapter molecule for the transduction of TLRs signals. Therefore, cDCs lacking MyD88 were investigated. CSE did not induce the release of CCL3 and CXCL2 from cDCs obtained from MyD88 knockout mice (Fig. 3C and D).
SEN:10029386	19052556	In response to hepatocyte cell death, MyD88 signalling was responsible for the activation of NF-?B and for the production of factors such as IL-6 (ReF. 122).

SEN:10029866	11350938	Immunoblotting with anti-Stat3 as well as anti-PKR anti bodies (Figure2E) showed an increase in interaction within 5?15 min of treatment with the growth factor, followed by a decrease to below basal level at later time points.
SEN:10029872	16763566	Consistent with previously published data (Williams et al, 2000), phosphorylation of S6K T389 and rpS6 S240/244 is abrogated in PDK1 null cells (Figure 3A, lanes 5–8).
SEN:10029876	12177059	Substitution of Arg-238, equivalent to conserved Arg in the 14-3-3 binding motif, with Glu (R238E) decreased 14-3-3theta binding to PDK1 (Fig. 3 C, upper panel, lane 4). In contrast, substitution of Val-243 with Pro (V243P), a residue conserved in many 14-3-3 targets, such as Raf-1 and Bad (Fig.3 A), dramatically increased the amount of 14-3-3theta bound to PDK1
SEN:10029878	12177059	Co-immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that mutation at Ser-241 impairs the PDK1 binding ability for 14-3-3theta and 14-3-3eta (Fig. 3 B, upper panel, lane 3, and data not shown).

SEN:10029920	18794886	Data coming from mice lacking p110a regulatory subunits have shed light on the dual role of p85 in PI3K regulation in response to insulin (Katso et al., 2001). Heterozygous deletion of either p85a or b in mice leads, surprisingly, to increased sensitivity to insulin, whereas compound heterozygous mutants fail to activate PI3K in response to insulin.
SEN:10029924	18794886	The loss of the regulatory subunit of PI3K1A, p85, results in the decrease of Pten activity in p85 liver conditional knockout mice (Barber et al., 2006).

SEN:10029936	16123140	The Pim-1 and Pim-2 transfectants have lower levels of serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity and the alpha- and beta-subunit B56gamma of the PP2A phosphatase do not coimmunoprecipitate in these cells. Thus, the effects of Pim on PP2A activity may mediate the levels of c-Myc and the phosphorylation of proteins needed for increased protein synthesis.
SEN:10029942	12095915	The level of tyrosine-phosphorylated Gab1 was greater in Pkd1-/- kidneys at E16.5 than in wild-type kidneys,

SEN:10029958	16046792	ApoE-deficient mice overexpressing human plasma PAF-AH develop less atherosclerosis due to reduced lipid accumulation, inhibition of neo-intima formation, and reduced macrophage attraction (108).
SEN:10029960	16046792	The decreased TNF and IL-1 plasma levels in PLA2R knockout mice indicate a potential role for PLA2R in the onset and progression of endotoxic shock (127).
SEN:10029962	11841347	In uPA deficient mice, wound healing is impaired at least partly due to suppressed migration of leukocytes, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells.

SEN:10030002	17722906	Mitochondrial ?-oxidation is also induced via the induction of several key genes, such as Acox1, Acsl4, and Cpt1a by 1.2-, 1.6-, and 1.7-fold, respectively; however, the 1.5-fold up-regulation of Acc2 may counteract mitochondrial oxidation by leading to increases in cellular content of malonyl-CoA, an allosteric inhibitor of CPT1a.
SEN:10030004	17722906	hese findings are similarly found in the colon, where cholesterol biosynthetic genes are up-regulated: Cyp51a1, Fdft1, Idi1, and Lss were induced 1.4-, 1.8-, 1.9-, and 1.3-fold, respectively. Lldr was induced to a lesser extent, but retained significance (1.4-fold).

SEN:10030022	10542237	Devchand et al. (11) showed that absence of PPARa expression in mice prolonged the inflammatory response.
SEN:10030024	14561188	PPARa elicits most of its anti-inflammatory effects at the vascular wall by negatively interfering with the NF-kB transcriptional pathway [25,26,28,29].
SEN:10030026	14561188	The first evidence of the involvement of PPARs in inflammation came from the demonstration that PPARa absence in mice prolonged the duration of the inflammatory response [9].

SEN:10030050	18422969	Target genes regulated basally by PPARgamma expression greater than twofold are listed in Table 1.
SEN:10030058	17618855	Moreover, PRDM16-transduced cells expressed several of the important thermogenic genes in a cAMP-dependent manner, similar to what bona fide brown fat cells do in culture and in vivo. The mRNA levels of UCP1, deiodinase-d2 and PGC-1alpha were increased by PRDM16 in unstimulated fat cells and induced to very high levels by PRDM16 in response to cAMP
SEN:10030060	17618855	At the molecular level, expression of genes common to both white and brown fat lineages were either not affected (PPAR? and adiponectin) or moderately elevated (aP2) by PRDM16 expression (Figure 2A).
SEN:10030062	17618855	Interestingly, the mRNA levels of several genes that are preferentially expressed in white relative to brown fat cells were significantly repressed by PRDM16 expression, including psat1, serpin3ak and resistin
SEN:10030066	23054396	TGF-beta1 treatment led to more rapid wound closure by both MDA-MB-231 and NMuMG cells. Blimp-1 knockdown reduced the basal level of wound closure and prevented its acceleration by TGF-beta1 in MDA-MB-231 (Figs. 1E and 1F and Supplementary Fig. S2) and NMuMG cells (Fig. 1G).
SEN:10030068	23054396	TGF-beta1 treatment of NMuMG cells has been shown to lead to EMT, as judged by the upregulation of mesenchymal markers Fibronectin, N-Cadherin and Vimentin (15). Knockdown of Blimp-1 overrode the characteristic upregulation of all three mesenchymal makers by TGF-beta1 (Fig. 1C).
SEN:10030070	23054396	Moreover, ectopic Blimp-1 expression was sufficient to increase levels of Snail in NMuMG and multiple breast cancer lines (Fig. 4B).

SEN:10030096	20167927	As shown in Figure 3B, AMPKalpha2-/- MAECs contained reduced IkBalpha levels and exhibited increased IkBalpha phosphorylation, which is required for proteasome-dependent degradation of IkBalpha.
SEN:10030098	20167927	Compared to LDLr-/-, the levels of P-p65 at Ser536 were dramatically increased in the aortas of LDLr-/-/AMPKalpha2-/- mice (Figure 8A).
SEN:10030100	20167927	Further, nuclear levels of p65 and p50 were significantly higher in AMPKalpha2-/- MAECs than in WT MAECs (Figure 3C).

SEN:10030174	19273391	Administration of PTEN-specific siRNA reversed PKB/Akt inhibition and mitigated apoptosis in diabetic mouse aortas. These findings therefore suggest that hyperglycaemia may promote apoptosis in endothelial cells through PKB/Akt downregulation, via a peroxynitrite-mediated, LKB1-dependent PTEN activation (46).
SEN:10030176	18794886	Pten-deleted muscle, liver or fat tissue exhibits increased glucose sensitivity (Stiles et al., 2004; Kurlawalla-Martinez et al., 2005; Wijesekara et al., 2005).

SEN:10030226	11127205	the presence of Sox4 mRNA in hypertrophic chrondrocytes within the mouse epiphyseal growth plate at sites that overlap or are adjacent to target cells for TPH and PTHrP, and its strong up-regulation via activated PTH/PTHrP receptors in OHS cells, makes it a promising candidate for mediated downstream effects of PTH and PTHrP in bone
SEN:10030232	18662538	TGF? stimulates PTHrP secretion without appearing to increase PTHrP mRNA levels. PTHrP stimulates the production of RANK ligand (RANKL) in osteoblasts, which in turn promotes the differentiation of osteoclast precursors and bone resorption. Administration of anti-PTHrP neutralizing antibodies inhibits TGF?-dependent osteolytic bone metastasis in mice (Kakonen et al., 2002).
SEN:10030236	8725172	Specifically, PTH and PTHrP rapidly and transiently induce expression of the mRNAs encoding IL-6 and LIF.

SEN:10030266	17992263	IL-6 production into the lung 24 hours after BLM treatment was attenuated in ASC–/– in comparison with ASC+/+ control littermates (Figure 9E). Comparable reductions of IL-1? and IL-6 were obtained in the BALF
SEN:10030268	17641058	ASC is essential for activation of caspase-1 and production of mature IL-1 in response to all of these inflammatory stimuli
SEN:10030270	17641058	Fig. 4A shows that ASC–/– BMDM were completely deficient in ATP-induced activation of inflammasome complexes as well as the coupled release of mature IL-1 and active caspase-1.

SEN:10030296	19349358	To begin to assess whether altered responses to TGFbeta may play a role in the phenotype of Rac1-deficient fibroblasts, we first used real time PCR analysis to show that Rac1-deficient fibroblasts possessed a modest, yet significant, reduction in TGFbeta2 mRNA expression (Figure 6B) suggesting that the primary defect in Rac1-deficient fibroblasts was not a defect in TGFbeta signaling.
SEN:10030298	10072071	rac2-/- neutrophils displayed significant defects in... and p38 and, unexpectedly, p42/p44 MAP kinase activation
SEN:10030304	18223157	We tested whether the expression of Rae-1 in primary lymphomas derived from an E-Myc animal would result in NK-mediated killing of cancer cells.

SEN:10030322	19223555	Moreover, tumors with conditionally expressed RASSF1A exhibited SAh-gal activity (Fig. 2C), which serves as an indicator for senescence occurring in vivo (8, 9), as well as enhanced p21Cip1/Waf1 expression (Fig. 2D).
SEN:10030324	19223555	Interestingly, we detected an increase in g-H2AX–positive cells in tumors conditionally expressing RASSF1A (Fig. 2D).
SEN:10030344	9178770	In addition, E1A can repress the activity of HBP1 via conserved region 1 sequences in a manner independent of the CBP co-activator.
SEN:10030350	16211301	These results indicate that Fas-mediated apoptosis induced by MSSP occurs independently of mitochondria.
SEN:10030356	16034410	We find that elevation of serum RBP4 causes systemic insulin resistance, and that reduction of serum RBP4 improves insulin action.

SEN:10030374	12897145	Expression of the cancer-related NF-kappaB target genes cyclin D1, c-myc, and bcl-xl was significantly increased in grossly normal transgenic mammary glands starting the first cycle of pregnancy and increased further in mammary carcinomas compared to mammary glands from wild-type mice or virgin transgenic mice.
SEN:10030376	17596446	Our results therefore indicate that it is possible to restore Bdnf protein levels in HD cells by attenuation of REST/NRSF binding at the Bdnf locus.
SEN:10030378	17596446	These experiments showed that 48 h after delivery of DN:REST into Hdh109/109 cells, Bdnf mRNA was increased to similar levels to that seen in untreated wild-type Hdh7/7 cells (Fig. 3a).
SEN:10030386	21602491	FIZZ2 significantly (p < 0.001) stimulated fibroblast proliferation at doses as low as 10 ng/ml, which appears to be maximal because no further significant increase was noted at higher doses (Fig. 5A).
SEN:10030388	12714564	Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (see {601232}) inhibited Retnlb-activated Akt phosphorylation and also inhibited RPSM proliferation.
SEN:10030390	21602491	Phosphorylation status of the three key MAPKs (ERK, JNK, and p38) and AKT in FIZZ2-treated MLFs were analyzed by Western blotting. The results showed rapid (10 min) marked activation of ERK by FIZZ2, with lesser effects on AKT and p38 (Fig. 5B). JNK was not activated by FIZZ2 treatment.

SEN:10030396	11536047	Over- expression of MEN2A-RET mutants reduced STAT3 ser727 phosphorylation to basal levels, suggesting that STAT3 tyr705 phosphorylation is a prerequisite for maximal MEN2A-RET induced STAT3 ser727 phos- phorylation (Figure 3b).
SEN:10030398	11536047	STAT3 tyr705 phosphoryla- tion was reduced when the MEN2A-RET single mutants tyr752phe or tyr928phe were overexpressed, while no STAT3 tyr705 phosphorylation was observed in the presence of the MEN2A-RET double mutant (Figure 3b).
SEN:10030400	11536047	As depicted in Figure 3a, mutation of tyr928 (RET) reduced STAT3 transactivation approximately 1.5-fold, indicating that other STAT3 docking sites must be present in MEN2A-RET as well.
SEN:10030402	11536047	As depicted in Figure 1a,b, over- expression of both MEN2A-RET and STAT3 strongly enhanced IRE transactivation, while overexpression of STAT3 alone did not affect reporter activation.

SEN:10030916	10585467	As depicted in Fig. 4, the genes for glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, ATP citrate lyase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and S14 were markedly activated by refeeding in the wild-type mice (Fig. 4 and Table II). In contrast, these refeeding responses were severely reduced inSREBP-1 ?/? mice.
SEN:10030918	14985341	Here we demonstrate that p53 is involved in the molecular mechanisms of hepatocellular injury associated with steatosis.

SEN:10031610	18411337	We show that the expression of a tumor necrosis factor receptor family member, death receptor 3 (DR3; also known as TNFRSF25), is selectively elevated in Th17 cells, and that TL1A, its cognate ligand, can promote the proliferation of effector Th17 cells.
SEN:10031614	20139367	TNF strongly induced nuclear translocation of RelA within 30 minutes, as shown by Western blotting of nuclear extracts (Figure 1B, left).

SEN:10031646	17127443	TPO is necessary for megakaryocyte maturation in that TPO deficient mice display greatly reduced megakaryocyte production as well as reduced numbers of mature megakaryocytes
SEN:10031648	18060035	In most cell types, STAT1 is primarily triggered by interferon signaling (21). However, TPO signaling phosphorylates STAT1 in WT megakaryocytes (10).
SEN:10031662	16129676	Consistent with our previous findings that TRAF2 and TRAF6 activate ASK1, H(2)O(2)-induced ASK1 activation and cell death were strongly reduced in the cells derived from Traf2-/- and Traf6-/- mice.

SEN:10031688	18155543	As shown in a number of in vivo studies using atherosclerosis-prone mice, a deficiency in p53, one of the main factors involved in senescence signaling (Fig 1), accelerates atherosclerosis development, possibly by increasing macrophage proliferation in atherosclerotic lesions.86-88
SEN:10031702	18955973	in p53-null MEFs, only Bcl-X(L) expression was suppressed, and Bcl-X(L) overexpression blocked apoptosis (Maclean et al., 2003).

SEN:10031726	14993219	Importantly, whereas phosphorylation of Thr- 389 (RPS6KB1 P@T412) in Tsc1- and Tsc2-null MEFs was inhibited by rapamycin, phosphorylation of this site was strongly resistant to inhibition by wortmannin.
SEN:10031730	18342602	Similar to the TSC1 deficiency, Tsc2-/- cells also exhibited increased PERK phosphorylation and XBP-1 splicing as well as increased GRP78 and CHOP expression compared to WT controls (see Figures S1A and S1B available online).

This result, obtained in adult liver of USF2 ?/? mice, was consistent with the 64% reduction in the amount of L-PK protein
SEN:10031820	10620020	We found that Fam interacted with beta-catenin both in vivo and in vitro. The Fam-binding site of beta-catenin mapped to the region close to the APC or Axin-binding site of beta-catenin. Over-expression of Fam in mouse L cells resulted in an elevation of beta-catenin levels and in an elongation of the half-life of beta-catenin.

SEN:10031888	12538525	This was confirmed by our observation that the expression of Pthrpr and Cbfa1 in the prehypertrophic chondrocytes was reduced and delayed and the expression of Col10a1, a hypertrophic chondrocyte marker, was absent in the Wnt5a–/– limb from 12.5 dpc to 15.5 dpc (Fig. 2B,C).
SEN:10031890	12538525	Wnt5a was expressed in non-hypertrophic chondrocytes under the control of rat Col2a1 promoter and enhancer (Nakata et al., 1993). At 14.5 dpc, Col10a1 expression domain was either reduced (Col2a1-Wnt5a number 17) or absent (Col2a1-Wnt5a number 25).
SEN:10031892	12538525	Col2a1 expression was increased in the cartilage of the Wnt5a–/– and Col2a1-Wnt5b mice, but decreased in the Col2a1-Wnt5a mice (Fig. 8B).
SEN:10031894	12538525	At 11.5 dpc, Ihh expression was detected in the future humerus, radius and ulna in the wild-type embryo. In the Wnt5a mutant, Ihh expression was only weakly detected in the humerus and absent in the radius and ulna (Fig. 2A),

SEN:10031902	12538525	luciferase assay of the Col2a1 reporter was performed in mouse primary chondrocytes (Fig. 8C). Col2a1-luciferase activity was suppressed by Wnt5a but increased by Wnt5b in a dosedependent manner.
SEN:10031906	12538525	when Wnt5b was overexpressed, cyclin D1 expression was upregulated in all undifferentiated chondrocytes
SEN:10031910	12538525	To test whether Wnt5b plays a similar role as Wnt5a in regulating chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, Col2a1-Wnt5b transgenic mice were generated. When the long bone phenotype of Col2a1-Wnt5b was further analyzed, we found that expression of both Ihh and ColX was undetectable at 15.5 dpc (Fig. 6C)
SEN:10031916	20175907	Wrn Delta hel/Delta hel mutant mouse embryonic fibroblasts exhibit increased oxidative stress. This was reflected by increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased oxidative damage in genomic DNA, changes in ATP/ADP ratios, and a disruption of the inner mitochondrial transmembrane potential when compared to wild type mouse embryonic fibroblasts.
SEN:10031920	20965422	Mice lacking XBP1 in neurons exhibit increased levels of baseline autophagy, which leads to increased turnover of an autophagic substrate, mutant superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1), and protection against mutant SOD1-induced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Hetz et al., 2009).

SEN:10031930	18775308	JNK phosphorylation was increased in XBP1-/- small intestinal epithelia compared to controls consistent with the described TRAF2-dependent function of IRE1 to activate JNK (Urano et al., 2000) (Fig. 4B).
SEN:10031932	18342602	In contrast, upon introduction of XBP-1s, Akt phosphorylation was readily detectable in Tsc2-/- cells. There was also an increase in IRS-1 protein levels in XBP-1sexpressing cells.
SEN:10031934	19490910	Indeed, C/EBPalpha protein levels were significantly decreased in differentiating XBP1-/- MEFs while C/EBPbeta levels remained largely unaffected (Figure 4A). Similar observations were obtained in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Figure S4A).

SEN:10032022	11741889	Notch signaling is involved in many cell fate determination events in metazoans. Ligand binding results in proteolytic cleavage to release the signal-transducing Notch intracellular domain (NICD). The nuclear protein RBP-J kappa, when complexed with NICD, acts as a transcriptional activator which, in turn, induces a target gene of Notch such as the repressors HES/E(spl) and HERP2.
SEN:10032036	10947953	In this paper, we report on a novel factor which regulates the TGF-beta response promoter.

SEN:10032210	11274184	CdCl(2), a potent inducer of HO-1, increased expression of ATF4 in mouse hepatoma cells, and detectable induction of ATF4 protein preceded that of HO-1 (30 min versus 2 h). A dominant-negative mutant of ATF4 inhibited basal and CdCl(2)-stimulated expression of a StRE-dependent/luciferase fusion construct (pE1-luc) in hepatoma cells but only basal expression in mammary epithelial MCF-7 cells
SEN:10032220	10671569	The results thus suggest that C/EBP-delta binds to the SIRE (Sterol-independent regulatory element, -17 to -1) region of the LDLR and regulates its transcription.

SEN:10032292	11278621	We demonstrate that the expression of collagenous proteins and collagen alpha2(I) (COL1A2) mRNA was inhibited following stable transfection of Fli-1 in dermal fibroblasts..... In contrast, Ets-1 stimulates COL1A2 promoter activity. In vitro binding assays demonstrate that both Fli-1 and Ets-1 form DNA-protein complexes with sequences present in COL1A2 promoter.

EMSA studies demonstrated that recombinant p50 bound to a nonconsensus kappaB site overlapping the proximal C/EBP binding site on the CRP promoter.
SEN:10032408	10993896	Nkx3-1 facilitated SRF binding to the complex Nkx-binding site (NKE) of SMGA. Expression of mNkx3-1 in heterologous CV-1 fibroblasts was unable to elicit SMGA promoter activity but required the coexpression of serum response factor (SRF) to activate robust SMGA transcription. Thus, SMGA is a novel target for Nkx3-1, and the activity of Nkx3-1 on the SMGA promoter is dependent upon SRF.

SEN:10032494	11252722	We demonstrated that ROR alpha is expressed in human primary smooth-muscle cells and that ectopic expression of ROR alpha1 inhibits TNFalpha-induced IL-6, IL-8 and COX-2 expression in these cells.
SEN:10032500	11244511	The mRNA levels of E-cadherin were also stimulated and snail mRNA expression was inhibited upon inhibition of ILK as determined by Northern blot analysis. These data establish that ILK regulates the transcription of snail which in turn regulates the expression of E cadherin.

SEN:10032516	11124935	Supershift assays showed that the transcription factors Sp2 and Sp3 are part of the complexes formed at the Sp1-3 site, and that Sp1 does not appear to be directly involved. The data indicate that complex formation is initiated at site Sp1-3, which appears to be essential for promoter activity. However, other regions of the proximal promoter may also contribute to the regulation of MAT2A gene expression.

SEN:10032536	11086058	Using transient transfection and EMSA, we demonstrate that IL-4-activated STAT-6 binds to two different SBEs in the human CD40 promoter to inhibit STAT-1 -mediated CD40 promoter activity.
SEN:10032542	10995766	Using cotransfection experiments, we find that SPBP enhances the transcriptional activity of various transcription factors such as c-Jun, Ets1, Sp1, and Pax6. Hence, SPBP seems to act as a transcriptional coactivator.
SEN:10032550	10698518	Further characterization of this protein has identified a family of three related genes, AP-2alpha, beta and gamma (Bosher et al., 1996).

These changes corresponded to the decline in the rate of neovascularization.
SEN:10032672	15788408	The ability of ATF4-/- MEF cells to increase VEGF mRNA levels following arsenite treatment was considerably less, with only a 2-fold induction.....Therefore, the screen of the putative AAREs in the sequence contexts appearing in the VEGF promoter demonstrated that only the +1767 AARE was capable of binding an ATF4-containing complex.

SEN:10032748	12896981	Mouse embryo fibroblasts nullizygous for C/EBPbeta had a proliferative advantage over cells with one or two functional copies of this gene. C/EBP inhibition enhanced the expression of the three major components of AP-1 in cycling CEF, namely c-Jun, JunD, and Fra-2, and stimulated AP-1 activity.

SEN:10032984	16098831	Foxa2 occupied its binding sites in all three target genes... Therefore, the decreased activation of the PEPCK, TAT, and IGFBP-1 genes in Foxa2-deficient hepatocytes that we observed solely in the fasted state (Figure 2) indicates that Foxa2 is essential to the transcriptional response to food deprivation.

Cotransfected lmx-1, however, activates the intact enhancer/promoter, and shPan-1 plus lmx-1 causes further activation (Fig. 8B).
SEN:10033286	16424013	Because c-Maf is a transcription factor, it is of interest to identify downstream target genes of its action that might contribute to malignant transformation of T cells.

SEN:10033882	12829715	In this report, the functional role of the neutral lipid metabolites, 15-deoxy-D12,14prostaglandin J2 and 9-hydroxyoctadecanoic acids, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARg) was evaluated in surfactant protein B (SP-B) gene regulation. These reagents down-regulated SP-B gene expression in respiratory epithelial cells at the transcriptional level in both cell line and whole lung explant systems.
SEN:10033890	12706490	we measured peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma mRNA and protein in BAT, because PPAR-gamma agonist can elevate UCPs mRNA levels in BAT.
SEN:10033896	12471115	PPARgamma agonists activated NF-kappaB (p50, Rel A, c-Rel) binding to the upstream kappaB regulatory element site of c-myc. Only doses of agonists that induced apoptosis stimulated NF-kappaB-DNA binding.

SEN:10033918	18250470	Mice lacking colonic RelA were sensitive to dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis. Although experimental colitis enhanced proliferation in cells lacking RelA, sustained epithelial cell apoptosis precluded mucosal healing and decreased animal survival.
SEN:10033920	18250470	Antiapoptotic Bcl-xL expression was significantly decreased in isolated RelA-null colonocytes (Fig. 4E). Other NF-{kappa}B-target genes such as XIAP, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 2, Casp8 and FADD-like apoptosis regulator (CFLAR, also called cFLIP), and survivin were not affected. We also found a notable decrease of IL-11 and IL-18 expression in isolated colonocytes of IEC-RelA?/? mice.
SEN:10033922	18250470	Of note, a significant elevation in NOD2 expression was found in ceca of IEC-RelA–/– mice, and TLR4 and TLR9 levels trended upward (p = 0.07).
SEN:10033924	17446175	MnSOD and Survivin are RelB targets in WEHI 231 cells. Knockdown of RelB caused a decrease in MnSod and Survivin gene and protein expression levels.
SEN:10033926	15470505	(from text): Both basal expression and induction of BLC, SDF-1, ELC and SLC mRNAs were defective in IkkalphaAA/AA (nonactivatable form) stromal cells. Similar defects in expression of these chemokines have been described in RelB-/- and Nfkb2-/- mice (Poljak et al, 1999; Weih et al, 2001)...(Figure 3 - legend): IKKalpha is required for recruitment of RelB to the Blc, Sdf-1, Elc and Slc promoters.
SEN:10033934	11830550	As in ROR{gamma}-/- thymocytes, expression of Bcl-XL mRNA was barely detectable in ROR{gamma}-/- lymphoblastic cells (Fig. 6)
SEN:10033936	18434325	Then, IL-17A promoter activity was examined with or without an ROR{gamma}t expression vector in the HEK 293T cells in which ROR{gamma}t was not expressed. In the presence of ROR{gamma}t, the promoter activity was significantly increased (Fig. 2A).
SEN:10033954	11287605	Coexpression of retinoid X receptor (RXR), a heterodimeric partner, and its ligand 9-cis-retinoic acid also synergistically activated the SREBP-1c promoter
SEN:10033960	14701874	We found that SATB2 can bind to MAR sequences of the endogenous immunoglobulin mu enhancer region and activate gene transcription.
SEN:10033962	10521394	Consistent with this finding, we report that p53 physically associates in vivo with HDACs. This interaction is not direct but, rather, is mediated by the corepressor mSin3a. Both wild-type p53 and mSin3a, but not mutant p53, can be found bound to the Map4 promoter at times when this promoter preferentially associates with deacetylated histones in vivo.
SEN:10033974	12270938	A similar BRE element is present within the BMP-responsive Nkx2-5 gene promoter (52, 55), suggesting that the Hex BRE represents a common response element for genes regulated by BMP signaling in the foregut region of the embryo.

SEN:10033978	18387947	We cotransfected –795Csrp2-luc with Smad3?C, a dominant negative Smad3 expression plasmid that lacks C-terminal phosphorylation and activation sites (30). In transient transfection assays, Smad3?C decreased Csrp2 promoter activity by 43% in the absence of TGF? (Fig. 9A). Furthermore, Smad3?C reduced TGF? induction from 350 to 139% (Fig. 9A).
SEN:10033980	18334541	Overexpression of Smad3/4 enhanced the TGF-?1-induced BAFF mRNA expression, and overexpression of a DN-Smad3 abrogated BAFF transcription in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A ).
SEN:10033986	15113840	Gel shift assays showed that the Sox1 and Sox2 proteins preferentially bound to E2 and E4. Moreover, disruption of E2 and E4 abolished the reporter gene expression in the lens. These results indicate that the newly identified enhancer with Sox elements activates the alphaB-crystallin promoter in the lens,
SEN:10034000	19554625	Figure 5. R-Sp1 decoy ODN suppressed TGF-beta1, fibronectin and alpha-SMA expression at 4, 6 and 8 weeks after transfection. (A) Western blot shows the inhibition of TGF-beta1, fibronectin and alpha-SMA expression by R-Sp1 decoy ODN injection.

SEN:10034004	16997394	We also demonstrated that the proximal region is a TATA-less promoter requiring an intact CCAAT-box and Sp1 binding for its basal activity.
SEN:10034024	10951586	Two Sp1 binding sites are present upstream from the CCAAT box which can bind Spl and contribute to A-myb promoter activity by 70 and 30%, respectively. The two Sp1 sites and CCAAT box together contribute to over 80% of A-myb basal promoter activity and are therefore the major regulatory elements.
SEN:10034026	10898786	A simple promoter such as that of the tyrosinase gene, comprising two E box motifs and an SP1 site, should in principle be active in all cell types, yet it is active specifically in melanocytes.
SEN:10034036	11114304	retrovirus-mediated restoration of PU.1 expression to PU.1-deficient myeloid cells resulted in expression of cell surface CD45 and restored phosphatase activity, confirming the role of PU.1 in the positive regulation of this well known signaling molecule.

SEN:10034056	12440980	Srebf1c ... imparts its selectivity towards activating genes involved in lipogenesis. Srebf2 ... is more restricted to regulating genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis... Srebf2 is absolutely required for the normal cholesterol homeostasis.
SEN:10034062	14985368	Our results demonstrate that the synergistic action of SREBP-1c and glucose metabolism via GK is necessary for the maximal induction of l-PK, ACC, FAS, and Spot 14 gene expression.
SEN:10034064	11923308	mRNA abundance of lipogenic enzymes, FAS, glycerol -3-phosphate acyltransferase, ATP citrate lyase, Spot14, was markedly reduced by SREBP1 deletion in Leptin deficient mice.
SEN:10034066	14512514	At least 10 additional genes involved in the detoxification of oxidized lipids (8 glutathione S-transferase family members; cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase; and M-LP, Mpv17-like protein) were also induced in TgSREBP-1a mouse livers

SEN:10034078	11145563	Srebf1a expression had a dose-dependent increase in both LDL receptor and Star promoter activities
SEN:10034082	15936931	This may occur in part through direct actions of SREBP1c on target promoters (including that of PPARg, and also indirectly by inducing the generation of a ligand for PPARg [21,22].
SEN:10034092	12659631	induction of either Srebp resulted in increased expression of mRNAs for sterol-regulated genes, elevated fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis and increased phosphatidylcholine synthesis
SEN:10034106	11145563	Srebf2 was relatively ineffective in stimulating Star promoter activity compared with Srebf1a Srebf1a and Srebf2 both stimulated LDL receptor promoter activity to a similar extent
SEN:10034108	12659631	CCTalpha mRNA was increased 2-fold by enforced expression of Srebp1a or Srebp2 stimulation of phosphatidylcholine synthesis by Srebps in cells is due primarily to increased fatty acid synthesis
SEN:10034122	18060035	enforced STAT1 expression promoted several features of megakaryocytic differentiation of G1ME cells, as evidenced by increased cell size (forward scatter) and increased DNA content, reflecting polyploidization (Figure ?(Figure1,1, A and B). Similar effects were produced by enforced expression of IRF-1, a major STAT1 effector (reviewed in ref. 26).
SEN:10034128	17549413	Results show that GQ-ODN T40214 and T40231 significantly suppress the growth of NSCLC tumors in nude mice by selectively inhibiting the activation of Stat3 and its downstream proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, survivin, VEGF, Cyclin D1 and c-myc; thereby, promoting apoptosis and reducing angiogenesis and cell proliferation.
SEN:10034134	12147685	the down-regulation of D1 and D2 cyclins by OSM was mediated by STAT3 but not by SHP2/Ras STAT3 activation is necessary and sufficient for down-regulation of D1 and D2 cyclins in fetal hepatocytes
SEN:10034138	11779161	events lead to activation of Stat signaling and result in the induction of proteins, such as bcl-2 and cMyc, both of which are critical regulators of cell cycle progression and apoptosis
SEN:10034142	17277312	Moreover, STAT3 overactivation also reduced GATA3 and T-bet expression but increased the expression of RORgammat, a transcription regulator of THi differentiation (20).
SEN:10034144	20038814	Inactivation of STAT3 by either the STAT3 inhibitor AG490 (Figure 7B) or knockdown by siRNA (Figure 7C) led to reductions in p63, Jagged1, and Hes1 in all the mTOR-activated cells examined
SEN:10034152	18663125	When CD4+ T lymphocytes of STAT4-deficient mice were stimulated in the presence of IL-12 and IFN-{gamma}, no induction of twist1 expression was detectable (Fig. 2 C).
SEN:10034154	18060035	Second, mice deficient for both STAT5A and STAT5B are thrombocytopenic, likely due to a reduction in functional hematopoietic progenitors (18).
SEN:10034160	12089351	Overexpression of wt-Stat5A resulted in earlier induction of C/EBP in L1-wt-Stat5 (Fig. 4A , compare lanes 35 and lanes 810), whereas induction of dn-Stat5A decreased C/EBP expression in L1-dn-Stat5 cells by d 9 (Fig. 4A , compare lanes 5 and 10).

Taf4b bound to the c-jun promoter via ChIP analysis. Importantly, we also detected the binding of TAF4b to the core promoter regions of the Ccnd2, Fst, Inhba genes but not to the 5? distal AP-1 enhancer region of the Vim promoter.
SEN:10034170	16670261	T-bet is required for the progression to the Th1 phenotype, because Tbx21-/- Th1beta cultures maintain the IL-17-secreting phenotype after 2 weeks of culture. Addition of IFN-gamma to Tbx21-/- Th1beta cultures cannot recover the progression to the Th1 phenotype, suggesting T-bet, rather than IFN-gamma, mediates Th1beta to Th1 progression.
SEN:10034176	16357323	In addition to the secretion of IFN{gamma}, overexpression of T-bet in T-bet–/– V{alpha}14i NKT cells was sufficient to induce granzyme B protein (Figure 4C) and the capacity to kill antigen-loaded CD1d+ target cells (Figure 5).
SEN:10034182	10761931	Ectopic expression of T-bet both transactivates the IFNgamma gene and induces endogenous IFNgamma production.
SEN:10034198	17195845	Our data indicate that cytokine gene expression in T(H)1 cells may be controlled by a feed-forward regulatory circuit in which T-bet induces Runx3 and then 'partners' with Runx3 to direct lineage-specific gene activation and silencing.
SEN:10034204	16357323	As was observed when T-bet was introduced into T-bet–/– V{alpha}14i NKT cells, introduction of T-bet into wild-type immature V{alpha}14i NKT cells induced the up-regulation of CCR5, CxCR3, FasL, and CD122 mRNA levels, while the expression of IFN{gamma} and granzyme B mRNA were unchanged (Figure 3D).
SEN:10034206	16357323	To assess whether TCR signaling could account for these differences, T-bet–/– V{alpha}14i NKT cells were infected as previously, sorted, placed on anti-CD3/CD28–coated plates for 2 days, and expanded in IL-2 for several days. Under these in vitro experimental conditions, CxCR3, CCR5, CD122, and CD95L mRNA levels were up-regulated in the T-bet–expressing cells, in agreement with our previous results.
SEN:10034212	11397944	T-bet, also known as T-box 21 (Tbx21) (24), was recently described as a trans-activator specific to IFN-g–expressing lineages that is sufficient to induce IFN-g even under TH2-polarizing conditions (5).

SEN:10034268	12968018	Compound mutant cells also show increased levels of p53 and induction of Noxa, a death effector p53 target gene, suggesting that cell death is potentially mediated by reactive oxygen species activation of p53.
SEN:10034270	18955973	It has been shown that c-MYC expression is transcriptionally repressed by p53, where p53 is bound to the c-MYC promoter and there is a decrease in the level of acetlylated histone H4 at the c-MYC promoter (Ho et al., 2005).
SEN:10034274	18955973	In addition to repressing transcription of c-MYC, p53 induces expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, a major mediator of p53-induced G1 growth arrest.

SEN:10034332	10567522	ZEB also binds to the promoter of pivotal hematopoietic genes (including those encoding interleukin-2, CD4, GATA-3, and alpha(4)-integrin), and mice in which ZEB has been genetically targeted show thymic atrophy, severe defects in lymphocyte differentiation, and increased expression of the alpha(4)-integrin and CD4.
SEN:10034338	18577233	We conclude that in the E11.5 heart GATA4/FOG2 complex directly binds Lhx9 cis-regulatory regions...... Thereafter in the control hearts Lhx9alpha/beta epicardial expression is promptly down-regulated; in contrast, mouse mutants with Fog2 gene loss fail to repress Lhx9alpha/beta expression.
SEN:10034344	19842832	Treatment of sputum cells from COPD patients with acetylcholine produced increased amounts of LTB4, which was sensitive both to treatment with a muscarinic receptor antagonist and to the inhibition of ERK- 1/2 phosphorylation. This increased LTB4 synthesis also directly correlated with increased neutrophil chemotaxis.
SEN:10034348	15531749	In NCI-H292 cells, the threshold concentration of acrolein was 10 Mormore, with 30 M significantly decreasing GSH levels (Figure 1).
SEN:10034352	15531749	The increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was reduced by pretreating the cells with AG1478, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Figure 2A). Pretreatment with AG1478 decreased the levels of MUC5AC mRNAinduced by acrolein or EGF (Figures 2B and 2C).
SEN:10034354	18951912	Treatment with 2 to 10 uM acrolein led to a significant increase in ATF3 expression. This increase was detectable in cells treated with 2 uM acrolein and was maximal at 10 uM.
SEN:10034356	18951912	Treatment with 10 uM acrolein led to a 3-fold increase in ATF4 protein 4h after treatment, which was comparable to the increase in AFT4 protein in thapsigargin-treated cells (Fig. 3A).

SEN:10034386	12869663	 Bilirubin was only recently recognized as a potentially important anti-oxidant of physiological significance (Stocker et al., 1987), although this property had already been known for some time (Bernard et al., 1954). Administration of bilirubin demonstrated to be cytoprotective in models of ischemic heart injury and oxidative damage (Dore et al., 1999; Clark et al., 2000).
SEN:10034388	18633191	HO-1 is a cytoprotective enzyme (6) that degrades the potent prooxidant heme to generate CO and bilirubin. CO is a vasodilatory gas that has anti-proliferative effects on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) (7) and has anti-inflammatory properties (8). Bilirubin is a scavenger for reactive oxygen species (ROS) (9). In addition, ferrous ion, another product of HO-1, upregulates ferritin, which also has scavenger activity.

SEN:10039856	16885377	CD40L was expressed on tumor cells that induced IL-10 from B cells (Fig. 4A) but not on MCA304 cells.
SEN:10039858	16885377	IL-10 production was significantly attenuated when tumor cells were cultured with CD40KO B cells compared with WT B cells, whereas differences in IL-10 levels were also observed between IL-10KO and CD40KO B cells (Fig. 4B).
SEN:10039860	16885377	These results indicate that B-cell IL-10 production is partially dependent on CD40-CD40L interactions.
SEN:10039862	16885377	Furthermore, IL-10 production by B cells was attenuated by anti-CD40L blocking antibody (Fig. 4C).
SEN:10039864	16885377	IFN-g production was diminished in BKO spleen cells by rIL-10 (Fig. 4D).
SEN:10039866	16885377	These results indicate that B cells may reduce IFN-g production by producing IL-10.
SEN:10039868	16885377	These results suggest that (a) IL-10 produced from B cells lowers IFN-g production and (b) this effect is partially CD40-CD40L dependent.
SEN:10039870	16885377	After washing, these “CD40-stimulating antibody-expressing'' MCA304 cells induced IFN-g from NK (Fig. 4G) and CD8 T cells (Fig. 4H), indicating that CD40-CD40L interactions can trigger IFN-g production.
SEN:10039876	19366834	The transition from normal to neoplastic glands in prostate cancer (PCa) is marked by a dramatic decline of IL-7 and BAFF/ BLyS production.
SEN:10039878	19366834	B-cell andT-cell expression of bcl-2 decrease, whereas the apoptotic events increase.
SEN:10039884	19366834	Prostate-infiltrating lymphocytes display low proliferation but wide expression of the antiapoptotic protein bcl-2.
SEN:10039886	19366834	The vast majority of prostatic lymphocytes, both stromal (organized in LFs, that is, CD20+ B-cell follicle encircled by parafollicular T-cell area, Fig. 4C-H, or not organized, Fig. 4I-K) and intraepithelial lymphocytes (Fig. 4L), strongly expressed the antiapoptotic protein bcl-2.
SEN:10039888	19366834	Loss of IL-7 and BAFF production in neoplastic prostatic glands is accompanied by reduction of CD8+ and CD20+ cell infiltrates.
SEN:10039890	19366834	Real-time RT-PCR revealed that, in contrast to normal prostatic glands, malignant glands showed low to absent, ~ 60 times lower than in the normal glands (Fig. 5A), IL-7 mRNA expression.
SEN:10039892	19366834	Expression of the chemokines B lymphocyte chemo-attractant, also called CXCL13, and secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine, also known as CCL21, which we previously found (2) associated with LFs, was lost too (Fig. 5B, c-e).
SEN:10039894	19366834	At the same time, the percentage of CD8+ cells with positive cytoplasmic staining for the antiapoptotic protein bcl-2 was decreased in PCa (85.1 + 5.3%; Fig. 5D, a and b), in comparison with the normal prostate (97.0 + 2.4%), as assessed by double CD8/bcl-2 staining on paraffin sections.
SEN:10039898	19366834	LCM followed by real-time RT-PCR examination of neoplastic glands versus normal glands revealed a low to absent, about five times lower than in the normal glands, BAFF mRNA expression (Fig. 5E).
SEN:10039934	21278302	In contrast, the adoptive transfer of CpG-activated B cells induced tumor arrest, associated with a reduced suppressive immune environment due to the lower recruitment of regulatory T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and CD81 regulatory T cells along with the reduced expression of suppressive cytokines such as IL-10 and transforming growth factor-(b.
SEN:10039952	21278302	Moreover, the expression of DR5, one of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors, was also increased in the lungs of mice transferred with CpG-pulsed B cells (Figure E4A).
SEN:10039954	21278302	Similarly, we observed a higher release of IL-18 (Figure E4B) and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling)-positive cells (data not shown) in the lungs of tumor-bearing mice adoptively transferred with CpG-pulsed B cells than in the other group of animals.
SEN:10039956	21278302	CpG treatment of B cells increased the levels of IFN-b (Figure 3B), lymphotoxin-b (LTb) (Figure 3C), IL-1b (Figure 3D), and IL-12p40 (Figure 3E) but reduced those of TNF-a (Figure 3F) and IL-10 (Figure 3G).
SEN:10040020	23365136	In contrast, only TLR7-9 ligands (single-stranded RNA and unmethylated CpG-ODN) reversed the phenotype (upregu-lated CD20 and downregulated CD25+CD81High; Fig. 4A; Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B) and blocked the regulatory activity of murine and human tBregs (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S3A-S3C).
SEN:10040024	23365136	Instead, B cells from these mice activated T-cell responses, as they induced proliferation of T cells (Fig. 5C and Supplementary Fig. S4A) and expanded GrzB-expressing CD8+ T cells (Supplementary Fig. S4B and S4C) that readily and significantly lysed 4T1.2 cancer cells (Fig. 5D).
SEN:10040028	23365136	However, we found that, compared with B-LPS or even with normal B cells, expression of 4-1BBL, an immunostimulatory receptor that activates CD8+ T cells and NK cells via4-1BB (37,38), was significantly reduced on murine and human tBregs (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. S6A and S6B).
SEN:10040030	23365136	However, BLC-arp/CpG treatment reversed the reduced expression of 4-1BBL on murine and human tBregs (Fig. 6C) as well as in vivo in tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 6D).
SEN:10040102	24043896	RSV inhibits tBreg-mediated Treg conversion by blocking TGF-b1.
SEN:10040104	24043896	Unlike control B cells from naive BALB/c mice, which did not induce Foxp3 in non-Tregs, regardless of the presence or absence of the inhibitor (Fig. 6A), tBregs or tumor B cells only converted Foxp3+ Tregs in the absence of SB431542 (Fig. 6A).
SEN:10040108	24043896	Similarly, in vivo, B cells from tumor-bearing mice treated with 50 mg RSV also failed to secrete significant amounts of TGF-P1 (RSV, Fig. 6D), whereas B cells from mock-treated mice with 4T1.2 cancer produced abundant TGF-b (p < 0.01, Mock versus RSV, Fig. 6D).
SEN:10040112	24043896	Importantly, like RSV, Stat3 inhibitors also inhibited TGF-P1 expression in tBregs (Fig. 7C), a key factor required for tBreg-mediated conversion of Foxp3+ Tregs from non-Treg cells (13).
SEN:10040170	16365420	Nor-NOHA treatment partially reversed suppression by both 4T1 and 4T1/IL-10 MSC, whereas l-NMMA treatment had no effect.
SEN:10040180	16365420	Therefore, 4T1/IL-1fi MSC express more ROS on a per cell basis than 4T1 MSC, and a significant amount of this ROS production is affected by arginase production.
SEN:10040208	17483367	To determine if 4T1-induced MDSC from EP2_/~ mice inhibit by the same mechanism, nor-NOHA, an inhibitor of arginase, was added to some of the D011.10 and clone 4 transgenic T-cell cultures of Fig. 4. Nor-NOHA reverses the suppression CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by both BALB/c and EP2_/~ MDSC, although it is more effective in reducing suppression of CD4+ T cells than of CD8+ T cells.
SEN:10040216	17942936	Results Tumor-associated inflammation is reduced in IL-1R—/— mice.
SEN:10040218	17942936	Canonical proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, MCP-1, TGFh, and IL-1h were significantly elevated in 4T1 tumor tissue.
SEN:10040222	17942936	Additionally, IL-1R—/— tumor tissue had less IL-12p70 and more TGFh and IFNg than tumor tissue from wild-type BALB/c mice.
SEN:10040248	17942936	A potential downstream candidate is the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-6, the production of which is reduced in IL-1R—/— tumor tissue (Fig. 1B).
SEN:10040272	18753637	In the presence of IL-12, NK cells produced larger amounts of IFN-g.
SEN:10040278	18753637	Addition of Fab fragments of anti-NKG2D mAb to the cocultures significantly reduced the secretion of IFN-7, whereas Fab fragments of the isotype-matched control mAb had no effect (Figure 5D).
SEN:10040294	18802069	However, NF-kB was phosphorylated in MDSC from both tumor-bearing and tumor-free mice within the first 10 min of incubation at a level comparable to activation by TNF-a, a NF-KB-dependent gene that is known to be activated by S100A8/A9 (22) (Fig. 3E).
SEN:10040296	18802069	We found that 4T1 cells secrete S100A8/A9 proteins (Fig. 3F) and 4T1 supernatants are chemoattractants for MDSC (Fig. 3G).
SEN:10040302	18809714	TCM prevented the down-regulation of S100A9 mRNA expression during differentiation in vitro (Fig. 1 A).
SEN:10040308	18809714	Gr-1+ cells isolated after a 5-d culture of HPCs with GM-CSF and IL-4 in TCM expressed substantially more S100A8 and S100A9 proteins than did Gr-1_ cells (Fig. 1 C).
SEN:10040336	18809714	Expression of the constitutively active STAT3 mutant STAT3C in ES cells maintained a high level of S100A9 expression after LIF withdrawal (Fig. 6, B and C).
SEN:10040338	18809714	STAT3 depletion resulted in the down-regulation of S100A8 and S100A9 gene expression (Fig. 6 E), as well as the levels of both proteins (Fig. 6 F).
SEN:10040340	18809714	Collectively, these data demonstrate that STAT3 up-regulates the expression of S100A8 and S100A9 both in vitro and in vivo.
SEN:10040342	18809714	Consistent with this hypothesis, amounts of ROS in the spleen and bone marrow were four- to fivefold greater in Gr-1+GFP+ cells from S100A9Tg mice than in Gr-1+GFP“ cells from wild-type and S100A9T mice (Fig. 7 A).
SEN:10040344	18809714	However, ROS levels in MDSCs from tumor-bearing S100A9KO mice were substantially lower than in tumor-bearing wild-type mice and were equivalent to ROS levels in naive wild-type mice (Fig. 7 B).
SEN:10040420	20605485	Both IL-6 and G-CSF treatment did not markedly change surface IL-4Ra amounts on BM cells; moreover, IL-6 had a detrimental effect on cell viability, thereby preventing any further functional characterization.
SEN:10040422	20605485	Despite the increased IL-4Ra expression following G-CSF treatment, this cytokine did not induce any appreciable imunosuppressive function in BM cells.
SEN:10040424	20605485	GM-CSF induced a significant increase (p = 0.028 versus untreated BM) of IL-4Ra expression, and BM cells cultured with this cytokine inhibited CTL activity in a dose-dependent fashion (Figures 1A and 1B).
SEN:10040432	20605485	When we analyzed the percentage of the different subsets of CD11b+Gr-1+ cells, percentages of CD11bhiGr-1hi and CD11bhiGr-1- cells were decreased in both C/EBPp-deficient strains, but subsets characterized by low and intermediate expression of the Gr-1 marker were significantly decreased only in fully ablated mice (Figure 3D).
SEN:10040442	20605485	Following separation of CD11b+ cells from MCA203 tumor infiltrate, we found that loss of C/EBPp caused a significant reduction in both arginase 1 (Arg1) and nitric oxide synthase 2 (Nos2) proteins (Figure 6A), two enzymes that were described as crucial components of MDSC inhibitory machinery (Bronte and Zanovello, 2005; Gabrilovich and Nagaraj, 2009).
SEN:10040446	20605485	Cytokines were able to upregulate IL-4Ra expression, but a more pronounced effect was obtained by G-CSF+GM-CSF combination (Figure 7B and Figure S6B).
SEN:10040466	20876310	Inhibition of iNOS with LMMA and of arginase I with nor-NOH completely abrogated suppressive activity of tumor-derived MDSC (Fig. 2 F).
SEN:10040468	20876310	Thus, MDSCs from the tumor use primarily arginase and NO to suppress T cell role, whereas splenic MDSCs use primarily ROS.
SEN:10040480	20876310	In contrast, hypoxia dramatically up-regulated expression of argl and inos (Fig. 5 C).
SEN:10040488	20876310	DFO caused significant up-regulation of the expression of argl and inos and a decrease in the expression of NOX components p47phox andgp91phox (Fig. 6, D and E).
SEN:10040490	20876310	Expression of argl and inos in HIF-1a-positive MDSC was dramatically up-regulated after transfer into the tumor site (Fig. 6 I).
SEN:10040494	20876310	HIF-1a-deficient MDSCs had substantially higher ROS production than their WT counterparts (Fig. 6 K).
SEN:10040496	20876310	Half of HIF-1a WT Gr-1- donor cells acquired the F4/80 marker of M$ and 20% became CD11c+ DCs (Fig. 7 A).
SEN:10040498	20876310	In contrast, HIF-1a-deficient MDSC acquired CD11c marker, with only 20% of cells expressing F4/80 (Fig. 7 A).
SEN:10040502	20876310	Hypoxia caused a dramatic up-regulation of arg1 and inos in HIF-1a WT MDSC, whereas a much smaller effect was observed in HIF-1a-deficient MDSC (Fig. 7 B).
SEN:10040508	21110318	Interestingly, in 4T1/IL-1p-tumor bearing mice the ratio of Lyc6low to Ly6Cneg MDSC was reversed, that is, this newly identified subpopulation of Ly6Cneg MDSC represented 75-90% of polymophonuclear (PMN)-MDSC in those mice (Figure 1C, D and Supplemental Figure 2A).
SEN:10040522	21110318	Using these markers we found a similar percentage of CD27+ NK cells in the bone marrow of all mice (Figure 4B), however, NK cells from 4T1/IL-1p-tumor bearing mice expressed 5-10-times less CD27 protein than NK cells from the other mice (Figure 4B).
SEN:10040524	21110318	Ly6Cneg MDSC affect NKG2D expression by NK cells in vitro and in vivo. Further analyses showed a rapid down-modulation of NKG2D but not NKp46 expression by NK cells after injection of 4T1- and 4T1/IL-1p-tumor cells.
SEN:10040526	21110318	The reduced expression of NKG2D occurred earlier and was more pronounced in 4T1/IL-ip-than in 4T1-tumor mice (Figure 5A and data not shown).
SEN:10040546	21213211	As shown in Figure 1c, with the differentiation of CD11b+Gr1+ cells from BMCs upon exposure to CT26 tumor, 1D8 tumor and tumor-associated factor PGE2, the expression of both pri-miR-223 and mature miR-223 was downregulated although there had a temporary up-regulation.
SEN:10040556	21213211	In contrast to miR-223 expression, CD11b+Gr1+ cells and both CD11b+Ly6G~Ly6C+ and CD11b+Ly6C+Ly6G+ subsets isolated from the spleens of mice bearing tumors had higher levels of expression of MEF2C than those from the spleens of disease-free mice (Fig. 3a).
SEN:10040558	21213211	Similarly, the expression of MEF2C was upregulated in the tumor-induced MDSCs (Fig. 3b) although there had a temporary downregulation.
SEN:10040574	21213211	Meanwhile, miR-223-engineered cells had reduced MEF2C expression when compared to controls (Supporting Information Fig. S7).
SEN:10040580	21378275	In the lung, the concentration of IL-6 was increased, which aberrantly activated oncogenic Stat3 and increased expression of Stat3 downstream genes in epithelial tumor progenitor cells.
SEN:10040582	21378275	Spontaneous emphysema and lung adenocarcinoma were sequentially developed after MMP12 overexpression.
SEN:10040590	21378275	MMP12 suppresses T-cell proliferation and function in vivo The CD4+ T-lymphocyte population was significantly decreased in the spleen of doxycycline-treated bitransgenic mice (5.58%) compared with that in untreated ones (21.14%), while the CD8+ T-lymphocyte population was less affected (Figure 2A).
SEN:10040594	21378275	The culture medium showed decreased secretion of IL-2, IL-4, and IFN7 in the activated MMP12-treated samples (Figure 2F).
SEN:10040598	21378275	CD11b+/Gr-1+ cells from doxcycline-treated bitransgenic mice showed the strongest inhibition on proliferation of wild-type CD4+ T cells (Figure 3C).
SEN:10040600	21378275	This inhibition was further confirmed by a significant reduction of IL-2 and IL-4 secretion, implicating a functional impairment of CD4+ T cells by CD11b+/Gr-1+ cells from doxcycline-treated bitransgenic mice (Figure 3D).
SEN:10040608	21378275	Compared with doxycycline-untreated bitransgenic mice, the expression levels of IL-1p, IL-6, MIP-2, and TNF-a were abnormally increased in the plasma of doxycycline-treated bitransgenic mice (Figure 4A).
SEN:10040636	21383238	The expression of miR-17-5p and miR-20a in tumor-associated MDSCs was found to be lower than in Gr1+CD11b+ cells isolated from the spleens of disease-free mice.
SEN:10040638	21383238	Tumor-associated factor downregulates the expression of both miR-17-5p and miR-20a.
SEN:10040640	21383238	STAT3 is regulated by miR-17-5p and miR-20a.
SEN:10040642	21383238	We found that miR17-5p or miR-20a affects STAT3 expression only at the protein level.
SEN:10040644	21383238	As shown in Fig. 2, the levels of STAT3 protein in RAW 264.7 cells transfected with miR17-5p or miR-20a mimics were indeed lower than in negative control transfected cells, whereas the transcription level of STAT3 was not affected.
SEN:10040646	21383238	As shown in Fig. 2, miR-17-5p and miR-20a also reduced the transcriptional and protein levels of p47phox and gp91 phox, two subunits of NADPH oxidase.
SEN:10040648	21383238	Thus, our results demonstrate that both miR-17-5p and miR-20a target the STAT3 3'UTR to reduce the expression of STAT3.
SEN:10040652	21383238	As a positive control, STAT3-targeted siRNAs also inhibit the expression of ROS and the production of H2O2 (Supplemental Fig. 3).
SEN:10040654	21383238	As shown in Fig. 3A and 3B, the transfection of miR-17-5p and miR-20a mimics reduces the expression of ROS and the production of H2O2 in the isolated tumor-associated MDSCs in the presence of PMA.
SEN:10040668	21383238	As shown in Fig. 5A, Gr1+CD11b+ cells isolated from the spleens of CT-26 tumor-bearing mice have lower levels of expression of both pri- and mature miR-17-5p and miR-20a than do Gr1+CD11b+ cells from the spleens of disease-free mice (p < 0.05).
SEN:10040670	21383238	As shown in Fig. 5B, tumor-associated factors can upregulate the expression of miR-17-5p and miR-20a, but the expression of miR-17-5p and miR-20a is downregulated after 6 h exposure to tumor supernatants.
SEN:10040672	21383238	Conversely, the expression of STAT3 was found to be upregulated after a temporary downregulation.
SEN:10040678	21383238	The role of miR-17-5p and miR-20a in the expression of ROS and production of H2O2 by CD11b+Ly6G+ can be blocked by miR-17-5p or miR-20a inhibitors.
SEN:10040682	21450901	Although control antibody-treated MDSCs from tumor-free and tumor-bearing mice had some background-cleaved caspase3 expression, Jo2 mAb-treated cells from both tumor-bearing and tumor-free mice had significantly higher levels of cleaved caspase3.
SEN:10040684	21450901	Jo2-treated MDSCs also contained activated caspase3 as detected by Western blot analysis (Figure 3B).
SEN:10040686	21450901	Ninety-two percent of Gr1+CD11b+ MDSCs treated with Jo2 mAb were strongly positive for cleaved caspase3, whereas only 5% of control mAb-treated cells were strongly positive.
SEN:10040706	21670304	These data indicate that during DMBA/TPA-induced squamous carcinogenesis TNF-a mediates tumor-promoting activity via regulatory B cells that repress antitumor immunity.
SEN:10040716	21670304	There were no other significant differences in leukocyte infiltrate.. CCL5, a T-cell chemoattractant, was increased threefold in untreated Tnf-/- epidermis compared with wild-type epidermis (Fig. 2C, Left) and also increased in DMBA/TPA-treated Tnf-/-epidermis compared with wild-type (Fig. 2C, Center).
SEN:10040718	21670304	IFN-y mRNA was 10-fold higher in untreated Tnf-/- epidermis than in untreated wild-type epidermis (Fig. 2D, Left) and was higher at all time points during DMBA/TPA treatment (Fig. 2D, Center).
SEN:10040720	21670304	CCL5 mRNA was lower in Tnf-/- epidermis after transfer of wild-type B cells, as was IFN-y mRNA at 10 wk (Fig. 2 C and D, Right).
SEN:10040724	21670304	LPS-stimulated CD19+ B cells isolated from Tnf mice produced less IL-10 and more total IL-12 (IL-12p70) than did CD19+ B cells from wild-type mice (Fig. 3C; P < 0.05).
SEN:10040730	21670304	We found that Tnf mice are deficient for CD19+CD21high B cells compared with wild-type mice, both in terms of percentage of cells and absolute number (Fig. 4C; P < 0.01, Fig. S2B).
SEN:10040732	21670304	DMBA/TPA-treated Tnf mice had more IFN-y+ T cells in spleens (P < 0.05) than wild-type treated mice (Fig. 4D).
SEN:10040800	21972293	This effect was abrogated by the addition of COX2 inhibitor during the generation of CM from cancer ascites cells.
SEN:10040810	21972293	Whereas the MDSCs isolated from cancer patients expressed COX2 and secreted high levels of PGE2 (Figure 4B) compared with control CD11b+ cells from normal blood, their PGE2 secretion was blocked by celecoxib treatment (Figure 4B).
SEN:10040908	22132131	Factors from murine pancreatic cancer cells cause the down-regulation of SHIP-1 expression, which may potentially contribute to MDSC expansion, and the suppression of CD8+ T cell immune responses.
SEN:10040910	22132131	qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses revealed the in vivo down-regulation of SHIP-1 expression in splenocytes from TB mice.
SEN:10040912	22132131	Western blot analyses also detected reduced SHIP-1 activity, increased AKT-1 and BAD hyper-phosphorylation and up-regulation of BCL-2 expression in splenocytes from TB mice.
SEN:10040914	22132131	In vitro, qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses detected reduced SHIP-1 mRNA and protein expression in control splenocytes co-cultured with Panc 02.03 cells.
SEN:10040918	22132131	Results from the Inflammatory Cytometric Bead Analysis (CBA) Kit detected pro-inflammatory factors Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-10 (IL-10) and Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1) to a greater extent than Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF), Interferon gamma (IFN-y and Interleukin-12p 70 (IL-12p70) in the supernatants of cultured murine Panc 02.03 cells (Figure 1a).
SEN:10040920	22132131	TB splenocytes have a reduction in SHIP-1 expression.
SEN:10040922	22132131	Quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) results detected a decrease in SHIP-1 mRNA expression in TB compared to control splenocytes (Figure 3b).
SEN:10040924	22132131	TB splenocytes have reduced SHIP-1 activity.
SEN:10040926	22132131	Western blot analyses did not detect phosphorylation of tyrosine 1020 on SHIP-1, in splenocytes from TB compared to control mice (Figure 4a).
SEN:10040928	22132131	TB splenocytes have increased AKT activity.
SEN:10040930	22132131	Western Blot results revealed hyper-phosphorylation of AKT-1 at Ser473 in whole splenocytes from TB compared to control mice (Figure 4b).
SEN:10040932	22132131	TB splenocytes have increased BCL-2 expression.
SEN:10040934	22132131	Western Blot results showed hyperphosphorylation of BAD at Ser112 in splenocytes from TB mice compared to control mice (Figure 4c).
SEN:10040936	22132131	Western blot results revealed an up-regulation in BCL-2 expression in splenocytes from TB mice (Figure 4d) compared to control.
SEN:10040938	22132131	Murine Panc 02.03 cells down-regulate SHIP-1 expression in vitro.
SEN:10040940	22132131	qRT-PCR analysis revealed a significant decrease in SHIP-1 mRNA expression in control splenocytes co-cultured with Panc 02.03 cells compared to control splenocytes cultured alone (Figure 5a).
SEN:10040942	22132131	In addition, western blot results revealed greater than a a 2-fold reduction in SHIP-1 protein expression in control splenocytes cocultured with Panc 02.03 cells compared to control splenocytes cultured alone (Figure 5b).
SEN:10040944	22132131	These results correlate with our in vivo data and show that Panc 02.03 cells are able to suppress SHIP-1 mRNA and protein expression in vitro.
SEN:10040962	22529296	L-NIL downregulates STAT3 activation and inhibits ROS production in MDSC.
SEN:10040964	22529296	However, ROS levels were dramatically upregulated in Transwell culture with MT-RET-1 cells (Fig. 2A, 2B), and upregulation of ROS was suppressed to levels below baseline by addition of L-NIL to coculture.
SEN:10040966	22529296	Coculture with MT-RET-1 cells also strongly upregulated levels of activated phospho-STAT3 in bone marrow-derived MDSC, and STAT3 activation was suppressed by addition of L-NIL (Fig. 2C).
SEN:10040968	22529296	Release of VEGF from tumor cells has also been shown to be upregulated by iNOS expression.
SEN:10040970	22529296	VEGF release by MT-RET-1 cells was reduced >2-fold by L-NIL in vitro (Fig. 3A) without evidence of direct toxicity to tumor cells (Supplemental Fig. 1B)..
SEN:10040980	22529296	ROS levels in MDSC from spleen of L-NIL-treated tumor-bearing mice were significantly reduced as compared with untreated mice (Fig. 6C).
SEN:10040982	22529296	Western blot analysis of total and phospho-STAT3 levels in MT-RET-1 tumors demonstrated robust phosphorylation of serine 727 and tyrosine 705 in tumors from untreated mice.
SEN:10040984	22529296	Treatment of both 4-d (data not shown) and 14-d MT-RET-1 tumors with L-NIL increased numbers of tumor-infiltrating and splenic CD4 and CD8 T cells in wild-type mice (Fig. 4B).
SEN:10040986	22529296	Whereas splenic T cell levels were reduced in the tumor-bearing state, L-NIL treatment restored numbers of splenic CD4 and CD8 T cells to numbers comparable to those seen in tumor-free mice (3 X 106 CD4 and 2.5 X 106 CD8 T cells) and reversed the splenomegaly observed in many tumor-bearing mice (data not shown).
SEN:10040990	22529296	L-NIL treatment of iNOS-deficient mice led to robust recovery of splenic CD4 and CD8 T cell numbers (Fig. 4B), demonstrating that the failure of host iNOS ablation to restore T cell numbers in tumor-bearing mice is not due to upregulation of iNOS-independent compensatory mechanisms in iNOS KO mice.
SEN:10040994	22544933	In this study, we identified microRNA-494 (miR-494), whose expression was dramatically induced by tumor-derived factors, as an essential player in regulating the accumulation and activity of MDSCs by targeting of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and activation of the Akt pathway.
SEN:10041002	22544933	miR-494 is highly expressed in tumor-expanded MDSCs.
SEN:10041006	22544933	As shown in Fig. 1C, significantly increased expression of miR-494 was detected in both subpopulations compared with their counterpart from tumor-free mice (granulocytic MDSCs, p < 0.01; monocytic MDSCs, p < 0.001).
SEN:10041010	22544933	Tumor-derived factors, especially TG'F-fH, markedly induce the upregulation of miR-494 in MDSCs.
SEN:10041012	22544933	As expected, we found that miR-494 expression was significantly induced by TCCM in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A).
SEN:10041014	22544933	As shown in Fig. 2B, we found that the expression of miR-494 in Gr-1+ CD11b+ cells was not affected by GM-CSF and IL-6, but interestingly, miR-494 expression was significantly induced by TGF-b1 treatment (p < 0.001).
SEN:10041016	22544933	Moreover, the induction of miR-494 was partially blocked by anti-TGF-p1 mAb in cells stimulated with 4T1 TCCM (Fig. 2C), and the upregulation of miR-494 was impaired in Smad 3-deficient Gr-1+ CD11b+ cells isolated from the spleen of Smad 3_/_ mice (Fig. 2D).
SEN:10041022	22544933	As expected, the expression levels of ARG1, MMP2, MMP13, and MMP14 were significantly upregulated in lv-494-infected MDSCs compared with those in lv-ctrl-infected MDSCs (Fig. 4B); moreover, lv-sponge overtly blocked the induction in the expression of these molecules.
SEN:10041028	22544933	As shown in Fig. 4G, OT-1 CD8+ T cell proliferation was significantly suppressed by lv-494-infected MDSCs in comparison with lv-ctrl-infected MDSCs, and this suppressive activity could be partially blocked by an ARG1 inhibitor nor-NOHA.
SEN:10041038	22544933	Notably, the PTEN protein level was significantly downregulated in tumor-expanded MDSCs compared with that in Gr-1+ CD11b+ cells from tumor-free mice, whereas PTEN mRNA expression showed no difference (Fig. 6A).
SEN:10041040	22544933	When the reporter plasmids with miR-494 mimics or the scrambled oligonucleotide were cotransfected to HEK-293 cells, we observed that the miR-494 mimics markedly decreased the luciferase activity (Fig. 6B).
SEN:10041042	22544933	Furthermore, transfection of lv-494 significantly decreased PTEN expression in MDSCs, thus suggesting that endogenous PTEN is targeted and regulated by miR-494 (Fig. 6C).. To confirm whether miR-494-induced activation of MDSCs was mediated by targeting of PTEN expression, we designed a lentiviral vector encoding 39-UTR-depleted PTEN to enforce the expression of PTEN in MDSCs.
SEN:10041044	22544933	Overexpression of PTEN in Gr-1+ CD11b+ cells did not affect the TDF-induced miR-494 up-regulation, whereas the increased expression of MMPs induced by TCCM were significantly blocked (Fig. 6D), and SDF-1/CXCL12-mediated MDSC migration was abrogated (Fig. 6E).
SEN:10041046	22544933	Significantly reduced PTEN expression was also detected in Gr-1+ CD11b+ cells after TCCM stimulation (Fig. 6G); this was inversely correlated with the phosphorylation levels of mTOR and NF-kB.
SEN:10041048	22544933	As shown in Fig. 6H, the increased levels of MMPs induced by TCCM were completely abolished by LY294002, suggesting that the Akt activity is indispensable for the activation of MDSCs.
SEN:10041050	22544933	BAY-117802 significantly blocked MMP13 expression but had a limited effect on the upregulation of MMP2 and MMP14, whereas rapamycin eliminated the expression of all MMPs.
SEN:10041052	22544933	TGF-p1-induced miR-494 was involved in the negative regulation of PTEN expression.
SEN:10041062	23878002	Upon coculture with OVA-stimulated TCR transgenic OT-1 splenocytes, WT MO-MDSCs suppressed T-cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, while IFN-yR-/- and STAT-1-/-MO-MDSCs almost completely lost their suppressive capacity (Fig. 1A and Supporting Information Fig. 2A for CFSE dilution).
SEN:10041064	23878002	Interestingly, when treating MO-MDSCs with recombinant IFN-y, only 72% of the population phosphorylates STAT-1, illustrating MO-MDSC heterogeneity and suggesting that only the IFN-y-responsive part of this population mediates suppression (Supporting Information Fig. 3).
SEN:10041068	23878002	The relatively minor importance of IFN-y is not due to a lack of IFN-y responsiveness, since IFN-y treatment of PMN-MDSCs uniformly phosphorylates STAT-1 (Supporting Information Fig. 3).
SEN:10041096	23878002	Conversely, SNAP increased Fas expression, although never to the levels seen with MO-MDSCs, suggesting that NO is crucial but not sufficient to maximize Fas expression on CD8+ T cells.
SEN:10041118	24127488	We found that both PLC72_/~ PMN- and MO-MDSCs had greater immune-suppressive effects on CD8+ T cell proliferation than WT MDSCs in both antigen- and mitogen-driven T cell stimulatory conditions (Fig. 5, A and B).
SEN:10041120	24127488	WT PMN-MDSCs predominantly produced ROS, whereas WT MO-MDSCs mainly released nitrites (Fig. 5, C and D).
SEN:10041122	24127488	In contrast, PMN-MDSCs and MO-MDSCs from PLC72~7~ mice released both high levels of ROS and NO (Fig. 5, C and D).
SEN:10041124	24127488	Results show increased p-catenin protein levels in PLC^2-deficient MDSCs treated with PDBu compared with untreated cells (Fig. 6 B), indicating that PLC^2 can regulate p-catenin levels via DAG-dependent PKC activation.
SEN:10041136	24127488	Consistent with this observation, the percentage of CD8+ T cells infiltrating the tumor was significantly increased in PLC^2cKO/p-cat.CA compared with PLC^2cKO (Fig. 7 E).
SEN:10041138	24127488	As expected from our previous result (Fig. 5 B), CD8+ T cell proliferation is strongly diminished by PLC^2cKO MDSCs compared with control.
SEN:10041144	24220241	Expression of Notch target genes hesl and hes5 was dramatically reduced in all 3 populations of cells isolated from TB mice as compared with the cells from naive mice (Fig. 1A and B).
SEN:10041146	24220241	The CSL/ CBF1-specific binding in HPCs from TB mice was substantially lower than the binding in HPCs from control mice (Fig. 1D).
SEN:10041148	24220241	Three-day culture of human CD34+ HPC with TCM from breast carcinoma MCF7 and small cell lung cancer cell line 81M1 caused significant (P < 0.01) decrease in the expression of HES1 (Fig. 1H).
SEN:10041152	24220241	Significant reduction in the expression of hes1 was observed, whereas no differences were seen in the expression of notch1 and notch2 (Fig. 2D).
SEN:10041154	24220241	Dramatic downregulation of all studied Notch ligands (Jag1, Jag2, Dll1, 3, and 4) was found in bone marrow from CT26 TB mice as compared with naive tumor-free mice (Fig. 2E).
SEN:10041156	24220241	In the absence of TCM, Dll1 caused 6-fold increase in hes1 expression.
SEN:10041160	24220241	Culture of HPC with TCM resulted in an increase in serine phosphorylation of Notch1 (Fig. 4A), whereas no tyrosine phosphorylation was detected (data not shown).. Analysis of the structure of Notch suggested a number of serine residues in RAM domain, phosphorylation of which could affect binding of Notch1 with CSL.
SEN:10041162	24220241	However, after mutations in S1901 and T1898, Notch1 construct lost binding to CSL in MDSC (Fig. 4C) and was associated with substantially reduced level of serine phosphorylation in the presence of TCM (Fig. 4C).
SEN:10041164	24220241	We observed that MDSC transfected with control siRNA cultured with TCM had significantly (P < 0.01) lower hes1 expression than cells cultured in complete medium.
SEN:10041166	24220241	Inhibition of CK2 abrogated serine phosphoryla- tion of ICN caused by TCM and restored interaction between ICN and CSL (Fig. 6B).. .
SEN:10041170	24220241	This was associated with significant increase in the expression of hes1 in these cells (Fig. 7C).
SEN:10041198	24259296	Conversely, PTIO prevented the T cell suppression effect induced by Mo-MDSC in both tumor models, without having an effect in G-MDSC suppression (Fig. 3b).
SEN:10041200	24259296	A significant prevention in the production of PNT by G-MDSC, but not by Mo-MDSC, was found in tumor-bearing gp91phox and eNOS null mice, as compared to MDSC from control mice (Fig. 4a).
SEN:10041202	24259296	4b and 4c), suggesting the fundamental role of eNOS and gp91phox in the PNT-linked suppression induced by G-MDSC.
SEN:10041210	24391219	High levels of miR-155 and miR-21 also were detected in bone marrow and spleen MDSC isolated from tumor-bearing mice.
SEN:10041212	24391219	As shown in Fig. 2C, the levels of miR-155 and miR-21 were significantly higher in MDSC derived from the BM, spleen, or tumor tissue in tumor-bearing mice than those in control mice.
SEN:10041226	24652403	e ALDH1 activity in human PC (N = 11); representative flow cytometry plot of human PC tumor gated on live EpCAM+ cells using Aldefluor assay.
SEN:10041228	24652403	Furthermore, GCSFR-/- mice exhibit a shift in the immune profile of PC tumors from a TH-2 to TH-1 immune response, characterized by increased expression of IFN-y, TNF-a and IL-12 with decreased expression of arginase-1, IL-6, TGF-P, IL-10 compared to WT mice (Fig. 2d).
SEN:10041236	24652403	These monocytes acquired a Mo-MDSC phenotype characterized by a significantly decreased expression of HLA-DR and increased expression of arginase-1 as well as the ability to suppress CD8+ T cell proliferation in vitro [29-32] (Fig. 4a-c).
SEN:10041248	24652403	While we found that IL-6 mRNA gene expression was significantly downregulated by STAT3 inhibition (Supplementary figure 11), IL-6 blockade using anti-IL-6 antibodies decreased but did not fully reverse the effect of Mo-MDSC on increasing the prevalence of ALDH1Bright CSCs.
SEN:10041254	24733360	Rip2-deficient tumors showed enhanced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, with elevated expression of zebl, zeb2, twist, and snail in the tumor microenvironment.
SEN:10041276	24733360	The majority were associated with myeloid differentiation and chemotaxis, including G-CSF, M-CSF, IL-16, MCP-1, TREM-1, TIMP-1, and IL-1a with relative levels shown schematically [27-33] (Fig 4A).
SEN:10041280	24733360	Increased levels of IL-4, G-CSF, and GM-CSF were observed in bladder tumors from Rip2-deficient compared to wild-type mice, while no differences were detected in IFNy and M-CSF expression, consistent with a tumor microenvironment fostering development of the tumor associated MDSCs (Fig 4C).
SEN:10041282	24733360	To investigate the influence ofRip2 in development of EMT, we examined expression of adhesion markers in intravesical tumors and observed decreased E-cadherin expression throughout the tumor with concomitant increased N-cadherin expression at the peripheral of the tumor in Rip2-deficient relative to wild-type mice (Fig 6A).
SEN:10041284	24733360	Consistent with prior literature, we observed decreased canonical NF-kB activation exhibited by decreased p-IkB expression in Rip2-deficient tumors (Fig 6B), suggesting NF-kB independent mechanisms to account for EMT [39].
SEN:10041288	24733360	We also examined expression of these EMT inducing genes in lungs containing metastases from Rip2 wild-type and -deficient mice, revealing a similar trend with statistical significance for increased twist expression in absence of Rip2 (Fig 6D).
SEN:10041328	25063873	Blocking STAT3 activation with the small molecule inhibitor JSI-124 significantly inhibited the accumulation of NIK and IDO expression in MDSCs.
SEN:10041330	25063873	Knockdown of NIK in MDSCs suppressed IDO expression but not STAT3 activation.
SEN:10041332	25063873	RelB-p52 dimers were found to directly bind to the IDO promoter, leading to IDO expression in MDSCs.
SEN:10041334	25063873	STAT3 activation-induced IDO expression is independent of direct binding of STAT3 to the promoter region of IDO gene.
SEN:10041344	25063873	Blocking STAT3 activation by JSI-124 dramatically decreased the levels of p52 and RelB in nuclei (Fig. 2C, p < 0.05).
SEN:10041346	25063873	The level of STAT3 phosphorylation in MDSCs was reduced at 30 min and completely suppressed at 4 h after treatment with JSI-124.
SEN:10041348	25063873	Consistently, the level of NIK in MDSCs started to decline at 1 h and was completely blocked at 8 h after JSI-124 treatment.
SEN:10041350	25063873	The level of IDO significantly decreased at 4 h after JSI-124 treatment (Fig. 3A).
SEN:10041352	25063873	In NIK knockdown MDSCs, the level of IDO protein was reduced significantly, but the level of pSTAT3 protein was not affected (Fig. 3B, 3C).
SEN:10041354	25063873	In contrast, both IDO and NIK expression were reduced by JSI-124 treatment in MDSCs (Fig. 3A).
SEN:10041356	25063873	RelB/p52 dimers directly bind to the IDO promoter to regulate IDO expression in MDSCs.
SEN:10041366	25063873	We isolated CD11b+ MDSCs from the spleen of JSI-124-treated mice and found decreased expression of p-STAT3, NIK, and IDO protein in CD11b+ MDSCs compared with those isolated from the controls (Fig. 6D).
SEN:10041374	25063873	Furthermore, a specific IL-6-neutralizing Ab significantly decreased the levels of p-STAT3, NIK, and IDO in MDSCs (Fig. 7E, p < 0.05).
SEN:10041404	16288283	Shown are the representative results from one of three independent experiments done in triplicate as in a. (c) Tumor-infiltrating NK cells (CD49b+) and granulocytes (Gr1+) from wild-type mice showed increased phospho-Stat3 compared with their splenic counterparts.
SEN:10041406	16288283	Furthermore, examination of tumor-infiltrating DCs showed that expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, CD80 and CD86 is considerably increased in Stat3-/- mice when compared to those from Stat3+/+ mice (Fig. 2d).
SEN:10041410	16288283	Analysis of phosphorylated Stat3 by flow cytometry showed that Stat3 was also constitutively activated in tumor-infiltrating NK cells and neutrophils (Fig. 3c).
SEN:10041412	16288283	Flow cytometry and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) indicated that IL-10 activates Stat3 in NK cells (CD49b+CD3-) and granulocytes (Gr1+; Supplementary Fig. 3 online).
SEN:10041414	16288283	Furthermore, our data showed that FasL expression was increased in Stat3-/-Gr1+CD11b+ neutrophils (Supplementary Fig. 4 online).
SEN:10041426	16288283	We showed that CPA-7 inhibits Stat3 but not Statl and Stat5 in DC2.4 mouse DC line (Supplementary Fig. 6 online).
SEN:10041428	16288283	Tumor-infiltrating DCs from the mice receiving CPA-7 24 h earlier showed considerably reduced phosphorylated Stat3 compared to vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 6b).
SEN:10041456	17312132	Treatment of 1D11 also reduced the conversion of CD4+ T cells into Treg cells and subsequent Treg cell-mediated suppression of antitumor immunity.
SEN:10041458	17312132	In summary, we havedemonstrated that tumor cells directly convert CD4+CD25_ T cells to Treg cells through production of high levels of TGF-^,suggesting a possible mechanism through which tumor cells evade the immune system.
SEN:10041460	17312132	More importantly, Foxp3+CD25+ T cells were also detected at the tumor sites (Fig. 1B).
SEN:10041462	17312132	These results suggest that coculture of purified CD4+CD25~ T cells with tumor cells TRAMP-C2, but not nontumorigenic NRP-152 cells, induces CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells.
SEN:10041464	17312132	Moreover, these results provide evidence that tumor cells can indeed directly convert CD4+CD25~ T cells into Treg cells.
SEN:10041466	17312132	In agreement with RT-PCR results, FACS analysis demonstrated increased protein expression levels of Foxp3 in T cells cultured in TRAMP-C2 CM (CM) as the Ctrl 25+ ; however, CD4+CD25~ T cells cultured with T cell medium (Ctrl) did not express Foxp3 (Fig. 2D, bottom panel).
SEN:10041468	17312132	T cells cultured with TRAMP-C2 CM (CM) produced virtually nondetectable amounts of IL-2, whereas T cells cultured with T cell medium (Ctrl) produced high levels of IL-2 (Fig. 3A).
SEN:10041470	17312132	In addition, T cells cultured with CM produced high levels of IL-10 and TGF-0 as compared with T cells cultured with T cell medium (Fig. 3, B and C).
SEN:10041472	17312132	T cells cultured with tumor cell CM suppress CD4+CD25~ T cell proliferation Next, the suppressive ability of T cells cultured with CM was examined in an in vitro functional assay.
SEN:10041474	17312132	T cells cultured with CM derived from tumor cells TRAMP-C2 or RENCA (CM/25_) suppressed CD4+CD25~ T cell proliferation, whereas T cells cultured with T cell medium (Ctrl/25_) did not (Fig. 4, A, C, and D).
SEN:10041476	17312132	The results indicated that tumor cells produced high levels of TGF-^, whereas the nontumorigenic NRP-152 and irradiated TRAMP-C2 cells had significantly lower TGF-^ production (Fig. 4E).
SEN:10041478	17312132	Furthermore, neutralization of TGF-^ completely changed the profile of cytokine production of these T cells, and cells now expressed high levels of IL-2 and low levels of IL-10 and TGF-^ (Fig. 3).
SEN:10041482	17312132	Taken together, these results have revealed a critical role of tumor-derived TGF-^ in conversion of CD4+CD25~ T cells into Treg cells.
SEN:10041490	17312132	However, immunofluorescence staining revealed that Foxp3 expression was absent in animals receiving 1D11 and present in animals receiving no treatment or control Ab 13C4 (Fig. 6A).
SEN:10041492	17312132	These results suggest tumor-derived TGF-^ converts CD4+ T cells into CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg cells in the tumor microenvironment and neutralization of TGF-^ using 1D11 abolished the conversion.
SEN:10041494	17804750	The forkhead transcription factor Foxp3 is highly expressed in CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Treg) and was recently identified as a key player in mediating their inhibitory functions.
SEN:10041496	17804750	Foxp3 expression was induced by transforming growth factor-(32 (TGF-(32), but not TGF-(31 stimulation in these cells, and was partially suppressed following antibody-mediated neutralization of TGF-(32.
SEN:10041498	17804750	Down-regulation of Foxp3 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) in pancreatic carcinoma cells resulted in the up-regulation of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-8 expression, providing evidence for a negative transcriptional activity of Foxp3 also in these epithelial cells.
SEN:10041500	17804750	Coculture of Foxp3-expressing tumor cells with naive T cells completely inhibited T-cell proliferation, but not activation, and this antiproliferative effect was partially abrogated following specific inhibition of Foxp3 expression.
SEN:10041502	17804750	In an initial analysis of microdissected pancreatic carcinoma tissue using Affymetrix chip technology, Foxp3 was among the up-regulated genes in some tumor samples (26); (Fig. 1A).
SEN:10041504	17804750	In accordance with the immunohistochemistry data pointing to FoxP3 expression in tumor cells (see above), Foxp3 expression was clearly detectable in several pancreatic carcinoma cell lines at both mRNA (Fig. 2A) and protein levels (Fig. 2B).
SEN:10041506	17804750	Treatment of PANC-89, Capan1, and Panc1 cells with TGF-h2 led to an up-regulation of the Foxp3 protein, which was moderate for PANC-89 and Capan1 and strong for Panc1 (Fig. 3A and D).
SEN:10041508	17804750	RT-PCR analysis detected a 13-fold (mean value of four independent experiments) increase of Foxp3 mRNA expression in PANC-89 cells after a 48-h stimulation with TGF-h2, whereas no such effect was evident after stimulation with TGF-h1 (Fig. 3B).
SEN:10041510	17804750	Moreover, the incubation of PANC-89 and Capan1 cells with anti-TGF-h2 antibody for 48 h clearly suppressed the Foxp3 signal (Fig. 3A ), suggesting that endogenously produced TGF-h2 maintains Foxp3 expression in pancreatic cancer cell cultures.
SEN:10041512	17804750	Specific down-regulation of Foxp3 in pancreatic carcinoma cells results in up-regulation of IL-6 and IL-8.
SEN:10041514	17804750	A screen for changes in cytokine secretion in these cells using the Raybiotec Cytokine Array (Hoelzel Diagnostica) revealed an increase of IL-6 and IL-8 in the culture supernatant, whereas other cytokines remained unchanged (data not shown).
SEN:10041518	17804750	In the cocultures, Colo357, PANC-89, and PancTu1 tumor cells strongly inhibited the proliferation of anti-CD3/anti-CD28-stimulated T cells (Fig. 4D).
SEN:10041520	17804750	As shown in Fig. 5B, CD25 GITR and CD69 were up-regulated after anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimulation, irrespective of the presence or absence of tumor cells.
SEN:10041522	17804750	When using these cells, we observed an ~ 45% recovery of T-cell proliferation in the coculture system (Fig. 5A).
SEN:10041530	20661468	TMV induce and promote proliferation of Treg
SEN:10041534	20661468	In cultures containing TMV, Treg expressing GITR, CTLA-4, FasL, CCR7, TGF-P1, Granzyme B, and perforin were increased (p<0.05 for all).
SEN:10041544	20661468	In addition, intracytoplasmic expression of phosphorylated SMAD2/3 and phosphorylated STAT3 in Treg was increased in the presence of TMV relative to Treg incubated in the absence of TMV (Figure 7C).
SEN:10041546	21217015	These results demonstrate that the TLR1/TLR2 agonist BLP may have a general tumor therapeutic property involving reciprocal downregulation of Treg and upregulation of CTL function.
SEN:10041550	21217015	CD8+ T cells isolated from BLP-treated tumor-bearing mice exhibited vigorous proliferation upon in vitro restimulation with 3LL tumor cells, whereas CD8+ T cells isolated from PBS-treated mice failed to do so (Fig. 2A).
SEN:10041552	21217015	Whereas PBS-treated Tregs retained their function and effectively suppressed CTL proliferation, BLP-treated Tregs lost their suppressive function, resulting in a marked CTL expansion in vitro (Fig. 3B).
SEN:10041554	21217015	BLP-treated Tregs from WT but not TLR2_/_ mice lost their suppressive function, as demonstrated indirectly by the increased CTL numbers in the DLNs and the higher levels of serum IL-2 and IFN-g found in mice receiving BLP-treated WT as compared with TLR2_/_ Tregs, regardless of whether the cotransferred CTL were from either WT or TLR2_/_ mice (Fig. 4B, 4C).
SEN:10041642	24949077	The mRNA expression of Foxp3 and RORyt in the spleen was very low in the normal control group but significantly higher in the model control group (P < 0.05).
SEN:10041646	24949077	SOCS3 protein expression was significantly downregulated in all groups except for the normal control group (P < 0.05).
SEN:10041648	24949077	Jak2 and STAT3 protein expression was significantly higher in the model control group than in all other groups (P < 0.05).
SEN:10041650	25080445	We found that PI3K-Akt pathway inhibitors selectively inhibit Tregs with minimal effect on conventional T cells (Tconv).
SEN:10041656	25080445	In tumors treated with the combination of MK-2206 with the vaccine, a significantly higher number of CD8+ T cells were detected in comparison with that of the nontreated group (P < 0.001; Fig. 5B).
SEN:10041704	25168696	Using the diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced rat liver tumor model and in vitro cell experiments, the percentage of CD4+CD25+Treg/CD4+ cells in the blood and the expressions of Foxp3+, IL-10, TGF-p, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4(CTLA-4) in spleen and liver tumors significantly decreased after LDR of the spleen in rats with liver cancer.
SEN:10041718	25168696	LDR reduces CTLA-4 expression on the CD4+CD25+Treg cell surface and inhibits CD4+CD25+Treg cell suppression of CD4+CD25-T cells CD4+CD25-T cells significantly proliferated because of the effects of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 stimulating factors.
SEN:10041720	25168696	This proliferation of CD4+CD25-T cells significantly decreased after the addition of antogenous CD4+CD25+T cells in a co-culture for 3 d, which indicates significant inhibition of CD4+CD25-T cell proliferation by the CD4+CD25+T cells.
SEN:10041722	25168696	After the addition of TGF-b or IL-10 blockers, CD4+CD25-T cell proliferation increased, and OD values increased from 0.54 ± 0.028 to 0.58 ±0.026 with no significant difference, although the addition of anti-TGF-P and anti-1L-10 decreased the inhibition function of CD4+CD25+T cells (Fig. 7D).
SEN:10041730	9023347	Hypoxia was capable of inducing VEGF mRNA in both immortalized and transformed endothelial cells (4.5-fold in cells expressing SV40 large T antigen alone or in combination with H-ras), but both baseline and induced VEGF mRNA expression was increased in cells containing activated ras (Fig. 4).
SEN:10041732	9023347	Treatment of cells with wortmannin, a steroidal inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (15), resulted in a decreased level of VEGF under hypoxic conditions but the fold stimulation of VEGF mRNA was not changed (Fig. 5).
SEN:10041734	9023347	Cells with activated ras demonstrated high level of expression of 72-kDa metalloproteinase (MMP-2, gelatinase A), and 92-kDa metalloproteinase (MMP-9, gelatinase B) compared with cells containing SV40 large T antigen alone.
SEN:10041736	9023347	Treatment of ras-containing cells with wortmannin resulted in a decrease in MMP expression (Fig. 6).
SEN:10041744	9023347	Since wortmannin inhibits VEGF and MMP activity, but does not restore TIMP activity, tumor-igenesis is not expected to be fully suppressed.
SEN:10041748	9023347	Wortmannin could inhibit ras-mediated induction of VEGF, but it did not inhibit the hypoxic regulation of VEGF.
SEN:10041750	9023347	This suggests that the hypoxic regulation of VEGF is independent of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase.
SEN:10041766	12842087	Mice deficient in matrix metalloproteinase-9, which cleaves tumstatin efficiently from Col IVa3, have decreased circulating tumstatin and accelerated growth of tumor.
SEN:10041774	12842087	We observed increased angiogenesis in the Col IVa3/tumstatin-deficient mice, as compared to the wild-type mice (Figure 2B).
SEN:10041778	12842087	Col IVa3/tumstatin-deficient mice had increased circulating VEGFR2-positive endothelial cells (Figure 2D).
SEN:10041796	16204059	Here, we show that ras-transformed cancer cells can also induce TSP-1 down-regulation in their adjacent nontransformed stromal fibroblasts, but not in endothelial cells, in a paracrine and distance-dependent manner.
SEN:10041800	16204059	Indeed, MDF528 nontransformed dermal fibroblasts, like many other types of normal nonangiogenic cells (12), express copious amounts of TSP-1 (Fig. 1B, lane 1), which becomes undetectable in their H-ras -expressing counterparts (528ras1 cells; Fig. 1B, lane 2; refs.
SEN:10041802	16204059	Down-regulation of thrombospondin-1 promoter activity in nontumorigenic dermal fibroblasts exposed to tumor cell-derived soluble mediator(s).
SEN:10041804	16204059	Interestingly, exposure of MDF-EGFP/TSP-1 fibroblasts to conditioned medium derived rom H-ras-expressing 528ras1 cancer cells (528ras1 conditioned medium) induced a near complete inhibition of GFP fluorescence as indicated by both confocal microscopy and flow cytometry (Fig. 2C, left).
SEN:10041806	16204059	Again, this effect was paralleled by comparable decreases in TSP-1 mRNA and protein expression in these cells exposed to 528ras1 conditioned medium (Fig. 2C).
SEN:10041808	16204059	In addition to the aforementioned paracrine properties of 528ras1 cells, we observed that also conditioned medium of human colorectal cancer cells harboring a mutant K-ras oncogene (DLD-1), but not that of a DLD-1 variant with genetically disrupted K-ras allele (DKO-3 cells), efficiently suppressed the activity of the TSP-1 reporter gene in MDF-EGFP/ TSP-1 cells (Fig. 4A).
SEN:10041810	16204059	Once again, we observed that expression of TSP-1 by the nontransformed MDFB6 fibroblasts was precipitously down-regulated when these cells were incubated with B6ras conditioned medium (Fig. 5A).
SEN:10041812	16204059	A, immortalized dermal fibroblasts (MDFB6) down-regulate TSP-1 protein expression in the presence of conditioned medium from their H-ras-transformed counterparts (B6ras CM); quantification of representative Western blot.
SEN:10041814	16204059	B, absence of TSP-1 down-regulation in Id1-deficient dermal fibroblasts exposed to conditioned medium of ras-transformed (528ras1 CM and B6ras CM) and neu-transformed (528neu CM) tumor cells.
SEN:10041816	16204059	Paracrine effects of various ras-driven cancer cells were detected at the level of TSP-1 protein, mRNA, and promoter activity (Fig. 2C).
SEN:10041820	16204059	In contrast, abrogation of TSP-1 suppression was observed (Fig. 6C) when MDF528 cells were incubated with dimethylsphingosine, a specific inhibitor of sphingosine kinase.
SEN:10041822	16204059	Thus, suppression of TSP-1 promoter activity by fraction 2 of 528ras1 conditioned medium was moderately sensitive to pertussis toxin but was completely abolished by dimethylsphingosine.
SEN:10041826	16352631	Results G-CSF treatment increased WBCs and neutrophils in peripheral blood and reduced the bone marrow SDF-1 level We treated mice with N-terminal-mutated recombinant human G-CSF, nartograstim (8 ig kg_1), and examined the number of total WBCs and neutrophils in peripheral blood to confirm its biological effects.
SEN:10041828	16352631	G-CSF treatment did not change the serum SDF-1 level (Fig. 1B), but 4 Mechanism of tumor angiogenesis activated by G-CSF significantly reduced the bone marrow SDF-1 level (Fig. 1C) as previously shown (21).
SEN:10041834	16352631	G-CSF treatment induced the increase of vessel density in tumor tissues, but did not affect the proliferation of HUVECs Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the tumor tissues revealed hyper-neovascularization in tumors from G-CSF-treated mice (Fig. 3A and C; total of six G-CSF injections).
SEN:10041836	16352631	Compared with control mice, we found an increase of tumor vessel density in G-CSF-treated mice.
SEN:10041844	16489015	These antagonists prevented monocyte stimulation of angiogenesis in vivo, macrophage colonization of tumors, and tumor angiogenesis.
SEN:10041846	16489015	In contrast to most normal tissues, tumors have a high macrophage content; an average of 199 + 33 F4/80+ macrophages per field can be observed in Lewis lung carcinoma tumors and an average of 61 + 1 F4/80+ macrophages per field can be observed in HT29 xenograft tumors grown in mice (Fig. 1A and B).
SEN:10041850	16489015	Integrin A4B1 mediates myeloid cell adhesion to endothelium in vitro.
SEN:10041852	16489015	Antagonists of a4h1 blocked monocyte attachment to VCAM, indicating that integrin a4h1 is a functionally active receptor for both CS-1 fibronectin and VCAM (Supplementary Fig. S4).
SEN:10041854	16489015	Treatment with integrin a4h1 antagonists, but not other antagonists, significantly suppressed the number of F4/80+ macrophages within tumors (Fig. 6A and B).
SEN:10041856	16489015	These antagonists also reduced blood vessel density within treated tumors (Fig. 6C and D) and partially suppressed tumor growth (Supplementary Fig. S5).
SEN:10041864	16510581	FBLN-3 expression in MB114 cells also prevented their activation of p38 MAPK, but not that of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), stimulated by VEGF (Fig. 2E).
SEN:10041866	16510581	Figure 3A shows that relative to control cells, FBLN-3 and FBLN-5 both decreased MB114 cell expression of MMP-2 and MMP-3 while simultaneously increasing that of the MMP antagonists, TIMP-1 and TIMP-3.
SEN:10041868	16510581	Although MB114 cell expression of TIMP-2 was unaffected by either FBLN-3 or FBLN-5, both FBLNs induced MB114 cell expression of the angiostatic molecule, TSP-1 (Fig. 3A).
SEN:10041870	16510581	Interestingly, although TIMP-3 expression was elevated basally in FBLN-5-expressing MB114 cells, only FBLN-3 stimulated TIMP-3 expression in tubulating MB114 cells (Fig. 3B).
SEN:10041872	16510581	Gelatin zymography of MB114 cell conditioned medium confirmed that expression of either FBLN-3 or FBLN-5 significantly reduced MMP-2 protease activity in tubulating MB114 cells (Fig. 3C).
SEN:10041874	16510581	FBLN-3 and FBLN-5 antagonize angiogenesis in vivo.
SEN:10041878	16510581	Moreover, recombinant FBLN-3 and FBLN-5 (Fig. 4B) both inhibited human HMEC-1 endothelial cell migration to fibronectin (Fig. 4C), whereas FBLN-5, but not FBLN-3, mediated their adhesion in an RGD-dependent manner (Fig. 4D; refs.
SEN:10041880	16510581	Figure 5A shows that bFGF stimulated significant vascularization of implanted Matrigel plugs, which was quantified by measuring plug hemoglobin contents (Fig. 5A) and microvessel densities (Fig. 5B).
SEN:10041890	16510581	More importantly, tumors derived from FBLN-expressing MCA102 fibrosarcoma cells also exhibited significantly reduced blood vessel densities compared with tumors derived from control cells (Fig. 6D ).
SEN:10041892	16510581	In addition, FBLN-3-expressing MCA102 tumors contained significantly enlarged regions of central and peripheral necrosis that were typically absent in their control counterparts.
SEN:10041896	17018627	DLD-1 human colon cancer cells that secrete ;C or ;C399tr grew at similar levels in vitro but grew much slower in vivo than mock-transfected cells.
SEN:10041898	17018627	The recombinant purified ;C399tr fragment markedly suppressed tumor growth, development of intra-tumoral vasculature, and tumor metastasis in vivo in the highly metastatic Met-1 breast cancer model.
SEN:10041902	17018627	gC induced caspase-3 activation in 8 hours in these cells in Matrigel (Fig. 2C).
SEN:10041904	17018627	DLD-1 colon carcinoma cells engineered to secrete ;C or ;C399tr grew slower than nonsecreting control cells in SCID mice.
SEN:10041908	17018627	;C399tr blocked the tumor growth, intratumoral vascularization, and metastasis of the highly metastatic Met-1 breast cancer in nude mice.
SEN:10041972	18056450	Hesl and Heyl mRNA was significantly increased in U87 cells (DLL4 cells versus EV cells, P < 0.01 for both genes; Supplementary Fig. S1C).
SEN:10041974	18056450	Similarly, expression of mouse Hesl (mHesl) and mHey2 was also increased in B16 cells (DLL4 cells versus EV cells, P < 0.05 for both genes).
SEN:10041980	18056450	For U87 xenograft tumors, mDLL4 expressed in tumor ECs and mHesl expressed in host stromal/endothelial cells were significantly increased in tumors overexpressing DLL4 (both P < 0.05).
SEN:10041982	18056450	In contrast, for B16 allograft tumors, all tested genes were significantly increased in DLL4-overexpressing tumors (P < 0.05).
SEN:10041984	18056450	In contrast, DLL4-overexpressing tumors displayed decreased vessel density and vessel number, yet exhibited larger vessels with large lumina (Fig. 3A ).
SEN:10041988	18056450	Double staining for hypoxyprobe-1 (pimonidazole) and mCD31 showed much reduced regions of intratumoral hypoxia in DLL4-overexpressing U87 tumors, significantly less than those in EV control tumors (5% compared with 18%; P < 0.01; Fig. 3C).
SEN:10041990	18056450	As shown in Fig. 3D, in vivo expression of mouse VEGFR2 protein in the large vessels was lower in DLL4-overexpressing U87 tumors compared with those of EV control tumors, suggesting that the large vessels were particularly modulated by the DLL4 signal.
SEN:10041994	18056450	Immunostaining for activated caspase-3, a marker of apoptosis, showed that the number of apoptotic cells was decreased in DLL4-overexpressing tumors compared with EV control tumors (P < 0.01; Fig. 3C).
SEN:10041998	18056450	Interestingly, hypoxia significantly increased VEGF production of PC3 (P < 0.05) but not U87 cells (P > 0.05) compared with normoxia.
SEN:10042006	18056450	However, there were residual well-organized large vessels with regular shape and large lumina in DLL4-overexpressing tumors after bevacizumab treatment (Fig. 4D).
SEN:10042010	18713838	Along these lines, Oncomine analyses comparing the gene expression profiles of 40 breast carcinomas versus seven normal breast tissues also found FBLN5 messenger RNA expression to be reduced in mammary tumors as compared with their normal counterparts (Figure 1A).
SEN:10042012	18713838	In stark contrast, we observed human breast cancers to contain abundant levels of FBLN5 protein, and in fact, to express more FBLN5 protein than did their normal counterparts (Figure 1B and C).
SEN:10042018	18713838	Indeed, actin cytoskeletal rearrangements (Figure 2B, red channel) were readily apparent in NMuMG that expressed FBLN5 (Figure 2B, green channel), which contrasted sharply with the normal cuboidal morphologies and cortical actin architectures exhibited by adjacent NMuMG cells that failed to express the FBLN5 transgene (Figure 2B).
SEN:10042022	18713838	Similarly, FBLN5 expression also enhanced the resting and TGF-P-stimulated EMT in 4T1 breast cancer cells (Figure 2C), suggesting that the oncogenic activities of FBLN5 are not restricted to NMuMG cells.
SEN:10042026	18713838	Moreover, we found that EMT stimulated by TGF-P (Figure 2E) or the process of mammary tumorigenesis (Figure 2F) both induced Twist expression, and more importantly, that FBLN5 significantly enhanced resting and TGF-P-stimulated Twist expression in normal and malignant MECs (Figure 2E and F).
SEN:10042034	18713838	Functionally, FBLN5 enhanced the EMT phenotype in normal (Figure 5A) and malignant (Figure 5B) MECs, as well as significantly augmented their tonic and TGF-P-stimulated invasion through synthetic basement membranes (Figure 5C; data not shown).
SEN:10042040	18713838	As above, both transcriptional responses mediated by FBLN5 were reversed by treating the cells with the type I MMP-2/3 or MMP-2/9 inhibitors (Figure 5D and E).
SEN:10042048	19967723	Mechanistically, endothelial a6-integrin deficiency elevated significantly VEGF-mediated angiogenesis both in vivo and ex vivo.
SEN:10042050	19967723	In particular, a6-integrin-deficient endothelial cells displayed increased levels of VEGF-receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and VEGF-mediated downstream ERK1/2 activation.
SEN:10042052	19967723	Blood vessels associated with IDC showed a significant reduction in mean a6-integrin pixel intensity when compared with blood vessels from normal breast tissue (**p < 0.0001, Figure 1b).
SEN:10042058	19967723	The results showed that there was a significant increase in tumour blood vessel density in a6fl/fl-Tie1Cre+ mice compared with a6fl/fl-Tie1Cre- controls (*p < 0.02, Figure 3b).
SEN:10042064	19967723	As predicted, the absence of a6-integrin reduced the ability of the a6-/— cells to adhere and migrate to Lm but did not affect the ability of these cells to adhere or migrate on Fn, Col or Vn (*p < 0.05, Figures 5c and 5d).
SEN:10042068	19967723	Western blot analysis revealed that VEGF stimulated the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in both a6fl/fl-Tie1Cre-and a6fl/fl-Tie1Cre+ endothelial cells and that the levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) detected in a6fl/fl-Cre+ endothelial cells after a VEGF stimulus were dramatically higher than those detected in a6fl/flTie1Cre- endothelial cells (Figure 6b).
SEN:10042070	19967723	Furthermore, blockade of VEGFR2 using the function blocking monoclonal antibody to VEGFR2, DC101 [26], ablated these enhanced VEGF-mediated responses, demonstrating that the enhanced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was via VEGFR2 (Figure 6b).
SEN:10042074	20027628	MMP-2 transcriptional suppression decreased VEGF, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) protein levels and AKT phosphorylation in lung cancer cells.
SEN:10042076	20027628	In addition, MMP-2 suppression decreased hypoxia inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a), a transcription factor for VEGF, as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA).
SEN:10042080	20027628	Moreover, A549 xenograft tissue sections from mice that treated with MMP-2 siRNA showed reduced expression of VEGF and the angiogenic marker, factor-VIII.
SEN:10042082	20027628	MMP-2 gelatinolytic activity was higher in cells infected with PBS (mock) and Ad-SV.
SEN:10042084	20027628	Further, we also show that Ad-MMP-2-Si inhibits MMP-2 protein and mRNA levels in NCI-H1299, another adenocarcinoma cell line (Supporting Information Fig. 1).
SEN:10042090	20027628	Ad-MMP-2-Si inhibits VEGF-mediated angiogenesis in vitro.
SEN:10042092	20027628	MMP-2 inhibition decreased VEGF shedding into TCM as compared to mock and Ad-SV-infected cells.
SEN:10042094	20027628	The extent of VEGF secretion into the TCM in Ad-MMP-2-Si-infected A549 cells was 2.01 ± 0.15 pg/lg (p < 0.01) as compared to 7.22 ± 0.84 pg/lg in Ad-SV-infected cells (Fig. 2b).
SEN:10042096	20027628	Western blot analysis indicated that VEGF and VEGFR-2 protein expression was decreased in Ad-MMP-2-Si-infected cells as compared to mock and Ad-SV-infected cells (Fig. 2c).
SEN:10042098	20027628	Ad-MMP-2-Si infection inhibited VEGF and VEGFR-2 expression by >85% (p < 0.01) and 65.00 ± 4.45% (p < 0.05), respectively.
SEN:10042100	20027628	As shown in Figure 2d, Ad-MMP-2-Si infection inhibited VEGF and VEGFR-2 mRNA transcription by 89.65 ± 2.01% (p < 0.01) and 68.65 ± 2.44% (p < 0.05), respectively.
SEN:10042104	20027628	As shown in Figure 5, rhMMP-2 restored Ad-MMP-2-Si-mediated inhibition of VEGF expression from 15.55 ± 6.21% (p < 0.01) to 67.96 ± 4.01% (p < 0.01).
SEN:10042108	20027628	These results suggest that MMP-2 downregulation inhibits expression of VEGF at the mRNA transcription level in A549 cells.
SEN:10042110	20027628	Ad-MMP-2-Si inhibits HIF-1a expression and activity in A549 cells A key stimulus for increased VEGF expression in lung cancer is hypoxia.
SEN:10042112	20027628	We could not detect HIF-1a expression under normoxic conditions; however, HIF-1 a was detected in A549 cells exposed to hypoxia (1% O2) for 12-16 hr.
SEN:10042114	20027628	As Figure 3a shows, Ad-MMP-2-Si infection inhibited HIF-1a expression by 96.13 ± 1.98% (p < 0.01) when compared to the controls.
SEN:10042116	20027628	As shown in Figure 3b, Ad-MMP-2-Si infection inhibited HIF-1a mRNA transcription by 81.21 ± 3.47% (p < 0.01) as compared to the controls.
SEN:10042118	20027628	As shown Figure 3c, HIF-1a activity substantially decreased in Ad-MMP-2-Si-infected A549 cells as compared to mock and Ad-SV infected cells.
SEN:10042120	20027628	As shown in Figure 4a, Ad-MMP-2-Si infection inhibited the expression of PI3K and phosphorylation of AKT (Ser-473) by 94.7 ± 1.95% (p < 0.01) and 98.9 ± 1.02% (p < 0.01), respectively.
SEN:10042122	20027628	As shown in Figure 4b, ectopic expression of constitutively active-AKT restored AKT phosphorylation and VEGF expression in Ad-MMP-2-Si-infected A549 cells.
SEN:10042126	20027628	The addition of rhMMP-2 to Ad-MMP-2-Si-infected A549 cells restored PI3K expression (from 13.25 ± 2.36%; p < 0.01 to 40.11 ± 2.32%; p < 0.01), phospho-AKT (from 9.45 ± 4.21% p < 0.01 to 60.22 ± 3.33%; p < 0.01) and VEGF (from 15.55 ± 6.21%; p < 0.01 to 67.96 ± 4.01%; p < 0.01) in A549 cell line (Fig. 5a).
SEN:10042140	20027628	Addition of rhMMP-2 markedly increased the phosphorylation of AKT and expression of PI3K and VEGF in mock and Ad-MMP-2-Si-infected cells (Fig. 6e) as compared to cells treated with Ad-MMP-2-Si only.
SEN:10042142	20027628	Ad-MMP-2-Si treatment inhibits VEGF expression and reduces blood vessel density in vivo We next sought to determine the effect of Ad-MMP-2-Si treatment on VEGF expression and angiogenesis in vivo.
SEN:10042186	22075979	Although in LLC the vascular density remained unaffected, a significant decrease in vascular density had occurred in B16.F10 tumors (Fig. 2e and f).
SEN:10042188	22075979	Treatment significantly reduced the overall CD31-positive surface area of B16.F10 tumors by approximately 2-fold, which was confirmed by a 3-fold reduction in mRNA levels of the endothelial marker molecules CD31 and VE-cadherin in the tumor (Fig. 2g and h).
SEN:10042190	22075979	VEGFR2/EGFR inhibitor therapy significantly down-regulated mRNA expression of the proangiogenic/vascular destabilization molecules integrin p3 and Ang2 3-fold and significantly upregulated mRNA levels of the vascular stability molecules Tie2 and N-cadherin approximately 3-fold in LLC (Fig. 3).
SEN:10042192	22075979	Furthermore, an approximately 1.5-fold decrease in PDGFRp expression was observed in LLC tumor vasculature upon vandetanib treatment, as well as a 9-fold upregulation of desmin, which, however, did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.08) because of interindividual variation between the mice.
SEN:10042194	22075979	In contrast, vandetanib treatment induced a 2.3-fold increase in eNOS mRNA in B16.F10 vasculature.
SEN:10042196	22075979	Strikingly, VEGFR2 staining was strongly diminished after treatment in both LLC and B16.F10 tumors (Fig. 5a—l).

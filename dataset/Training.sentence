SEN:10012052	12734185	In fact, disruption of p53 in ob/ob mice completely suppressed the p53-regulated genes to wild-type levels and partially restored expression of lipogenic enzymes.
SEN:10012054	12734185	Thus, the activation of p53 might constitute a negative feedback loop against excess fat accumulation in adipocytes
SEN:10012060	14985341	This activation of the p53 pathway leads to the elevation of p21 mRNA expression, which can be considered an indicator of p53 activity,
SEN:10012064	1423616	Finally, IR induction of the human GADD45 gene, an induction that is also defective in AT cells, was dependent on wild-type p53 function. Wild-type but not mutant p53 bound strongly to a conserved element in the GADD45 gene, and a p53-containing nuclear factor, which bound this element, was detected in extracts from irradiated cells.
SEN:10012078	11807984	Furthermore, we found that Opn expression was upregulated by DNA damage-induced Tp53 activity and by adenovirus-mediated transfer of the human TP53 gene. In addition, a luciferase assay showed that the Opn gene has a functional Tp53-responsive element in its promoter region, and a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed interaction between the Opn promoter and Tp53 protein in vivo.
SEN:10012080	12067065	That hypothesis is consistent with the presence of a functional p53-response element within the promoter region of the mouse SIP gene and confirmed by the induction of SIP mRNA expression in mouse embryo fibroblasts upon activation of a p53-dependent pathway by transfection with rasV12 or rasV12/E1A

SEN:10012100	16297464	The activation capacity of the related USF-2, c-Myc and HIF-2alpha proteins was lower compared to USF-1 suggesting that USF-1 is the major E-box-binding transcription factor regulating the Prnd promoter.
SEN:10012110	12117816	Altered translational activation resulted in defective processing of protamine 2 and severe defects in sperm morphogenesis
SEN:10012112	12117816	Translational repression of protamine 1 (Prm1) mRNA requires sequences present in its 3' untranslated region (UTR) and substantial evidence suggests a role for the murine Y-box protein MSY4 in this process
SEN:10012120	18687992	Chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays show the direct binding of Zfp143 to the Nanog proximal promoter. Knockdown of Zfp143 or mutation of the Zfp143 binding motif significantly downregulates Nanog proximal promoter activity. Importantly, enforced expression of Nanog is able to rescue the Zfp143 knockdown phenotype, indicating that Nanog is one of the key downstream effectors of Zfp143.
SEN:10015356	14764725	To confirm that antioxidants also affected functional, downstream effects of IKK activation, we examined cytoplasmic levels of IkBa in neutrophils treated with LPS alone or with LPS plus NAC or alphaTOC. In neutrophils challenged with LPS, IkBa underwent time-dependent degradation (Fig. 3B). However, in neutrophils incubated with LPS and either antioxidant, no degradation of IkBa was apparent.
SEN:10015378	19898975	Figure 1 shows that the addition of 100 ng/ml mouse recombinant visfatin for 18 h generates ROS in myotubes, which were partially inhibited by the antioxidant NAC (reduced by approximately 40%).
SEN:10015386	18566440	Because IFN-g is known to induce NOS2, an important mediator of inflammation and host defense, we also analyzed effects of acrolein exposure on LPS-mediated induction of NOS2 (28) and observed a strong trend toward reduced NOS2 expression after acrolein exposure
SEN:10015388	18566440	LPS-induced production of Th1 cytokines, especially IFN-g, again appeared to be reduced by acrolein exposure (Fig. 6C), although no statistically significant effects were seen on LPS-induced induction of mRNA of these cytokines (data not shown).

SEN:10015410	19846878	Including adenosine with IFN-gamma treatment delayed any measureable increase in STAT1 activation by >60 min, and led to significantly reduced STAT1 activity at 60, 120, and 240 min post-stimulation compared with cells treated with IFN-gamma alone ( p < 0.05; Fig. 4).
SEN:10015420	10628744	Binding of PIAS1 to human AR DNA+ligand binding domains was androgen dependent in the yeast liquid beta-galactosidase assay. PIAS1 binding to full-length human AR in a reversed yeast two hybrid system was also androgen dependent.

SEN:10015430	10542280	Angiotensin II induces the tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat3. Under High Glucose condition both the extent and the duration of phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat3 was increased.
SEN:10015436	18155543	Treatment of VSMCs with AG-II was observed to induce premature cellular senescence (overexpression of p53/p21) and increase the production of proinflammatory cytokines through nuclear factor-B activation; both effects were neutralized by blocking the p21 pathway.97 The same effects of AG-II were also observed in vivo in a mouse model of atherosclerosis.97
SEN:10015438	18762784	Furthermore, angiotensin II increased the proportion of senescent VSMCs and induced the expression of proinflammatory molecules, as well as p21, in aortic atherosclerotic lesions in a mouse model of atherosclerosis.33

SEN:10015480	17992263	MMP-2 (76 kDa) activity was elevated only at day 11 in C57BL/6 mice but not in MyD88â/â and IL-1R1â/â mice (Figure 4B).
SEN:10015482	17992263	MMP-9 activity was significantly upregulated in BALF at day 1 in C57BL/6 mice but not in MyD88â/â mice, and only partially in IL-1R1â/â mice (Figure 4A).
SEN:10015486	17209037	The former studies demonstrate that TGF-1 and bleomycin are potent stimulators of the propeptide and mature forms of MMP-12 (Fig. 10,Aand B).
SEN:10015488	17992263	Latent TGF-?1 was detected after activation in BALF from WT mice 7 days after BLM administration, but was not detected in BALF from MyD88- or IL-1R1âdeficient mice (Figure 5G)
SEN:10015494	10744722	As shown in Fig. 3A in normal cells, IR causes activation of Chk2/Cds1 (lane 2), and this activation is inhibited by prior treatment of cells with caffeine (lane 4).
SEN:10015496	10744722	Immediately after IR, an increase in serine 216-phosphorylated Cdc25C was observed in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 1B, lane 2), and prior treatment of cells with caffeine inhibited this increase (Fig. 1B, lane 4).
SEN:10015498	10744722	As shown in Fig. 6A, ATM immunoprecipitated from irradiated cells was more active than that from unirradiated cells, and both the basal and radiationinduced ATM activities were inhibited by caffeine with an IC50 at around 200 M.

SEN:10015518	16713977	Because LPS induces Egr-1 activation via phosphorylation of the transcription factor Elk-1 (Guha et al., 2001), we investigated whether PPARgamma modulates LPS-induced Elk-1 phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of Elk-1 was barely detectable in untreated cells; addition of LPS resulted in a rapid increase in nuclear Elk-1 phosphorylation. This increase was inhibited an average of 36% in the presence of CO (Figures 3A?3C).

SEN:10015726	14747657	Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in NIH 3T3 cells, we show that heme, an inducer of ho-1, promotes displacement of Bach1 from the MafK-occupied ho-1 enhancers, which is followed by Nrf2 binding to these elements.
SEN:10015728	17682061	As shown in Fig. ?Fig.3A,3A, FLAG-Bach1 was rather stable in the absence of hemin, but it disappeared more rapidly in the presence of hemin. Its half-life was shortened less than 1 h by the presence of hemin (Fig. ?(Fig.3B).3B). We conclude that heme induces degradation of Bach1 in vivo.

SEN:10016094	19768117	To determine if BAX and BAK are activated in response to NO, wild type MEFs were treated with DETA-NO for 24 hours and BAX and BAK activation was determined using antibodies that specifically recognize the activated form of these proteins [20], [23]. Indeed, BAX and BAK are activated in response to NO treatment indicating that both of these proteins regulate NO-mediated apoptosis (Figure 1E/FFigure 1).
SEN:10016100	19768117	To determine if NO activates JNK upstream of BAX and BAK, we treated Bax?/?/Bak?/? MEFs with DETA-NO and assessed JNK activity by measuring expression of phoshpo-cJun, a downstream target of JNK.

SEN:10016152	20348279	This revealed that the C/EBPa antibody disrupted the 3rd DNAprotein complex (Fig. 7C, ââ) and supershifted the complex (Fig. 7C, arrow), whereas rabbit IgG had no effect. These results indicated that the binding of C/EBPa to the C/EBP binding site on the HO-1 promoter is specific and increased by PGN.
SEN:10016154	20348279	In the presence of PGN (Fig. 5, filled bars), Elk-1 and Ets-2 further increased HO-1 promoter activity by 12.2- and 7.5-fold, respectively, compared with baseline pCI control (P 0.05; Fig. 5A).

(taof is inferred from increased phosphorylation and increased promoter binding)
SEN:10016824	12088279	PGF2alpha is able to inhibit Pparg functions in adipogenesis. This occurs through subsequent Pparg phosphorylation and inhibition of its transcriptional activity.
SEN:10016832	16124869	In cells treated with DTT, the level of c-myc mRNA was not increased until 2 h after treatment in wild-type cells (Figure 2B). By contrast, no significant change in c-myc mRNA levels was observed in Perk-/- MEFs upon DTT treatment (Figure 2B), indicating that the induction of c-myc expression by DTT is PERK-dependent.

SEN:10017004	11815629	Again, in control cells, cytochrome c was localized in the mitochondria, whereas in the presence of LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor), cytochrome c was released into the cytosol. Similarly, treatment with 4-OHT strongly induced cytochrome c release into the cytosol in FKHR-L1(A3):ER* Ba/F3 cells.
SEN:10017040	21317532	we treated cells with IFN-g, resulting in a several-fold increase in monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) expression. Nicotinic acid strongly inhibited this effect in macrophages from WT but not from GPR109A-deficient mice (Figure 6A).
SEN:10017060	18824549	(from text) Similar to EGFR, our studies demonstrated that ADAM17 surface expression on lung epithelial cells was up-regulated in IL-13 transgenic mice (Fig. 3, f and g) and OVA-sensitized and challenged mice (Fig. 3f).

These studies demonstrated a significant increase in intracellular AMCase in both of the modeling systems (Fig. 2, aâd).
SEN:10017064	18824549	(from text) The increase in intracellular AMCase in these Th2 inflammation/asthma models was paralleled by an increase of total EGFR in lung lysates (Fig. 3a) as well as specific EGFR surface expression on lung epithelial cells as analyzed by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 3b) and flow cytometry (Fig. 3, c and d).
SEN:10017094	10207013	Stimulation of EC with TNF-a and/or Ox-LDL for 24 h increased the number of MT1-MMP-bearing cells to about 1.8-fold (Ox-LDL), 1.7-fold (TNF-a), or 2.5-fold (TNF-a and Ox-LDL together) as compared with unstimulated cells (Fig. 6B - flow cytometric analysis of HSVEC using purified mouse monoclonal antibody to human MT1- MMP.)
SEN:10017202	10698680	PDK1 was first identified by its ability to phosphorylate Thr308 of PKBa in vitro [17,29,30]. As this activity was absolutely dependent on the inclusion of PtdIns(3,4)P2 or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in the reaction mixture

SEN:10017410	18794886	(Harrington et al., 2004). The mechanism of this transcriptional repression depends on the activation of mTORC1 signaling, as rapamycin treatment and silencing of S6K genes restores IRS-1 levels.
SEN:10017424	20038814	Because the enhanced NF-kB signaling in Tsc2-/- MEFs was abolished by rapamycin treatment, NF-kB signaling appeared to be downstream of mTORC1 (Figure 10A).
SEN:10017566	17548647	In WT mice, MMP-12 was induced upon exposure to cigarette smoke, as shown by Western blots on lung homogenates from WT nonsmoke exposed and smoke-exposed mice (Fig. 6A).

By contrast, expression of Srx1 protein was low in Nrf2?/? mice and did not change significantly with CS exposure (Figs. 1B and C).
SEN:10017644	19027064	Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2-/- mice were exposed to CS for 5 h and then examined for expression of Srx1 by real-time RT-PCR. Srx1 mRNA level was upregulated by eight-fold in response to CS in Nrf2+/+ mice. No induction was observed in the lungs of CS-exposed Nrf2-/- mice (Fig. 1A).

SEN:10017810	10946303	TNF-a induced COX-2 expression in NCI-H292 cells. When the cells were exposed to 10 ng/ml of IL-1b, TNF-a, or IFN-g, 1 mg/ml of LPS, or 1 mM TPA, only TNF-a and TPA stimulated COX-2 expression (data not shown).
SEN:10017828	10194465	Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), the class of insulin sensitizers that act through the nuclear receptor PPAR-g, increase CAP expression levels and c-Cbl phosphorylation significantly in adipocytes (54), possibly contributing to their insulin sensitizing effect

SEN:10018060	10446041	Whereas FAK is phosphorylated on tyrosine upon assembly of focal adhesions, it becomes phosphorylated on serine and disassociates from Src and p130CAS during mitosis (14). These events may loosen cell-substrate contacts and allow cells to divide and move apart.
SEN:10018072	11806755	In both BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, a neutrophil infiltration was observed after the sequential application of lipopolysaccharide and N-Formyl-Met-Leu-Phe. However, 5 times less neutrophil was found in C57BL/6 mice when compared to BALB/c mice. This was reflected in the neutrophil activation parameters measured (myeloperoxidase and elastase activities).

SEN:10018096	12871976	ER stress induces CREB1 phosphorylation and ATF1/CREB1 binding to the Grp78 promoter. Through the use of adenoviral vector expression systems, we provide evidence that when ATF4 function is suppressed and its binding partners are not able to compensate for its function, Grp78 induction by Tg and Tu is partially inhibited.

SEN:10018100	16680093	As shown in Fig 1C, ER stressinduced JNK activation was recovered in RIP-reconstituted RIP-/- cells, even though the protein level of RIP was much lower in RIP-reconstituted cells than in WT cells (Fig 1B). These results indicate that RIP, like TRAF2, is essential for JNK activation in response to ER stress.
SEN:10018102	12840028	Recently, Novoa et al. (29, 31) demonstrated that GADD34, also known as Myd116 in mouse, promotes the dephosphorylation of eIF-2alpha and is induced by both ER stress and amino acid deprivation.

SEN:10018116	15545625	Here we show that mTOR inhibition by hypoxia requires the TSC1/TSC2 tumor suppressor complex and the hypoxia-inducible gene REDD1/RTP801. Disruption of the TSC1/TSC2 complex through loss of TSC1 or TSC2 blocks the effects of hypoxia on mTOR, as measured by changes in the mTOR targets S6K and 4EBP1, and results in abnormal accumulation of Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF).

SEN:10018160	20158611	Collectively, these results demonstrate that hypoxic hepatocytes activate latent TGF-beta1 and that this stimulates hepatocyte EMT.
SEN:10018162	15592500	As evident from Figure 1a, the 10-fold increase in VEGF mRNA induced in mouse embryonic fibroblasts under hypoxia was not matched by a similar increase in the amount of secreted protein, which was merely two-fold.

SEN:10019736	16979664	A cytokine release assay using antibodies to Tumor Necrosis Factor-alfa (TNF) was performed (Fig. 3D). TNF- release in response to HSP70 and (to a lesser extent) following ssPolyU treatment was blunted in SiRNA-TLR7 transfected RAW264.7 cells versus the parental cells or mocktransfected cells

SEN:10019808	19158396	Considering that vinculin stabilizes FAs and thereby decreases cell migration (Ziegler et al., 2006), the contribution of this protein to both increased FA content and lower migration of T-FGM and MEF AhR-/- fibroblast (Mulero-Navarro et al., 2005; Gomez- Duran et al., 2009) deserves further consideration.
SEN:10019816	18769721	To determine if XIAP enhanced proinflammatory gene expression in vivo, we performed qRT-PCR analysis on splenic RNA from WT and XIAP knockout mice.

SEN:10020488	16034410	To circumvent the possibility of developmental or compensatory effects of RBP4 overexpression in transgenic mice, we purified recombinant human RBP4 and injected it into normal, adult FVB mice. RBP4 is a 21-kDa protein that is easily filtered through the renal glomerular membrane. In the circulation, RBP4 binds transthyretin (TTR) to form an 80-kDa protein complex that prevents renal clearance of RBP4 (ref. 20).

SEN:10020654	18955973	it has been recently shown that ATM is critical for p53 activation and the induction of apoptosis in response to c-MYC, suggesting that, in at least some cases, the ARF and ATM pathways cooperate with c-MYC to activate p53 and promote apoptosis (Figure 1a; Pusapati et al., 2006).
SEN:10020696	12909585	we treated quiescent fibroblasts with IL-1 or IFN-, and RNA was harvested and analyzed (Fig. 6). Treatment with IL-1 alone and with IL-1 in combination with IFN- completely abolished fibulin-5 mRNA expression.
SEN:10020744	19570822	We made use of the fact that heterologous overexpression of MyD88 activates downstream signaling and therefore expressed the Nlrp3 promoter luciferase construct alone or together with MyD88. Indeed, co-expression of the Nlrp3 promoter-luciferase construct with MyD88 led to a ~10-fold induction of luciferase activity indicating that MyD88-mediated signaling can activate the promoter of Nlrp3.

SEN:10021054	16470226	PI3K activation, however, results in the recruitment of the serine/threonine kinase PDK1 (3-phosphoinositidedependent protein kinase 1) to the plasma membrane, where PDK1 subsequently phosphorylates and activates another serine/threonine kinase, AKT 86. AKT positively regulates the function of the transcription factor NF-kB by phosphorylating inhibitor of NF-kB (IkB), which is a key regulator of NF-kB 87.
SEN:10021076	11790801	Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is required for EMT, whereas activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) causes scattering and protects from TGFbeta-induced apoptosis.

SEN:10021268	10938266	Our results indicate that autocrine secretion of PRL stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-2 by Jak2, provides docking sites for Grb2 and stimulates Ras-MAP kinase cascade, thereby causing unrestricted cellular proliferation.
SEN:10021272	10080909	Using these methods, we found that JAK2 was essential for signal transduction but that loss of TYK2 made no appreciable difference in tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream molecules, including Mpl, STAT3, and Shc (33).....In fact, tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs and DNA binding assays seem to be almost interchangeable measures of transcriptional activity.
SEN:10021276	11090623	Sixth, based upon the activity of different forms of VEGF ligands, VEGFR2 but not VEGFR1 ligation was capable of activating integrins, and this conclusion was confirmed by overexpression of VEGFR2 in cells.

SEN:10021336	10733581	Indeed, ERK directly phosphorylates TTF-1 at three serine residues, and concomitant mutation of these serines to alanines completely abolishes ERK-mediated phosphorylation both in vitro and in vivo.
SEN:10021342	10446041	Integrin signaling may be needed for the transcription of cyclin D1, because the cyclin D1 promoter is coordinately regulated by JNK and ERK (37) (Fig. 4).

SEN:10021366	10779545	At least two p38-dependent 5-LO kinase activities were found. Based on migration properties in in-gel kinase assays and immunoreactivity, one of these was identified as mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAP kinase 2). The other appeared to be MAPKAP kinase 3
SEN:10021370	10542369	We have shown that MAP/microtubule affinity regulating kinases (MARK) can phosphorylate the microtubule-associated-proteins MAP4, MAP2c, and tau on their microtubule-binding domain in vitro. This leads to their detachment from microtubules (MT) and an increased dynamic instability of MT. In CHO cells expressing MARK1 or MARK2 under control of an inducible promoter, MARK2 phosphorylates an endogenous MAP4-related protein.
SEN:10021372	10436023	<C39> Cdc25C Ser216 also binds and is phosphorylated by CTAK1 (Peng et al., 1998). Cdc25C Ser216 is phosphorylated throughout interphase but not in mitosis (Peng et al., 1997).

SEN:10021400	10856237	The N-terminal kinase is activated by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) through phosphorylation of Ser227, and phosphorylates the substrates of RSK.
SEN:10021402	10698680	PDK1 has now been shown to play a central role in activating many of the AGC subfamily members (reviewed in [150,151]). Apart from phosphorylating PKB on Thr308, PDK1 phosphorylates the equivalent residues on PKC isoforms [48,152,153], p70-S6K [32,154], the three isoforms of SGK [27,28,155] and PKA [156] (Figure 6).
SEN:10021404	10698680	As purified or recombinant PDK1 only phosphorylated Thr308 of PKBa and not Ser473, it was assumed that the phosphorylation of Ser473 would be catalysed by a distinct protein kinase, tentatively termed PDK2 [29]. Recent evidence (discussed below) suggests that PDK1 itself, rather than a distinct kinase, may phosphorylate PKB on Ser473 in vivo.
SEN:10021406	10805725	Both enzymes are characterized by the presence of a C2 domain at the carboxy terminus and, in vitro, preferentially utilize phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate as lipid substrates.

SEN:10021506	17068149	BMP9 also activates the Id1 promoter-derived BMP response element (BRE) in a dose-dependent manner (EC50 = 45 +/-; 27 pg/ml) and this activation is abolished by silencing ALK1 expression
SEN:10021508	15284439	We identified this kinase to be the G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (Grk2), and we showed that it acts on S633 in the C terminus of ?-ENaC. The kinase increases the activity of the channels and renders them insensitive to the ubiquitin protein ligase Nedd4-2.
SEN:10021512	22003059	ROS production with ischemia was significantly reduced in lungs with knockout of Akt1 while the response of Akt2 null lungs to ischemia was similar to wild type (Fig. 4A and B). Thus, Akt1 is required for activation of endothelial ROS production with ischemia.

SEN:10021528	20038814	We first investigated whether hyperactive mTOR could cause abnormal Notch signaling by monitoring the levels of Hes1, a direct target of Notch. We found that Hes1 protein expression was dramatically elevated in cells with constitutively active mTOR caused by loss of the Tsc2 or Pten tumor suppressor gene or oncogenic myristoylation of AKT1 (myrAKT1) (34) (Figure 2A).
SEN:10021532	16982679	The reduced level of p53 protein in myr-Akt1 salivary glands corresponds with an increase in MDM2 phosphorylation in vivo, suggesting that the Akt/MDM2/p53 pathway is responsible for suppression of apoptosis. Dominant-negative Akt blocked phosphorylation of MDM2 in salivary acinar cells from myr-Akt1 transgenic mice.
SEN:10021534	20038814	Both TA-p63 and deltaN-p63 were overexpressed in cells with mTOR activation because of either a lack of Tsc2 or Pten or expression of AKT1-E17K, and were repressed by rapamycin
SEN:10021536	11861503	Heterologous expression of Akt1/PKB(alpha) potently suppressed MCK gene transcription without affecting myogenin gene transcription, whereas heterologous expression of Akt2 increased myogenin and MCK gene transcription.
SEN:10021538	20038814	upregulation of Jagged1 by mTOR was due, at least in part, to higher levels of Jagged1 mRNA in the Tsc2-null and mutant AKT-expressing cell lines (Figure 3B) and appeared to be directly responsible for Notch activation and Hes1 expression, as these were blocked by decreased Jagged1 expression using siRNA (Figure 3C).
SEN:10021546	15109499	we show that in cultured myotubes undergoing atrophy, the activity of the PI3K/AKT pathway decreases, leading to activation of Foxo transcription factors and atrogin-1 induction.
SEN:10021552	18955973	Furthermore, inhibition of ATM/ATR kinases abolishes both induction of Rad51 and phosphorylation of p53 and reduced the level of apoptosis induced by coexpression of oncogenes and ARF (Pauklin et al., 2005).

SEN:10021562	19023129	Point-mutation and in vitro kinase analyses showed that PPARgamma was phosphorylated by Bcr at serine 82.
SEN:10021564	19023129	Overexpression of wild-type Bcr kinase did not inhibit ligand-mediated PPARgamma1 S82A mutant transcriptional activity, indicating that Bcr regulates PPARgamma activity via S82 phosphorylation.

PGC-1 binds to various transcription factors to maximize transcriptional activity, and leads to up-regulation of mitochondrial enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism and electron transport, as well as mitochondrial DNA replication
SEN:10021582	15262994	Specifically, Cn and CaMK have been shown to activate PGC-1a gene transcription through myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) and cAMP response element binding protein (12). in transgenic mice skeletal muscle specific overexpression of Cn* or CaMK* results in increased expression of PGC-1a (7,13).
SEN:10021588	9192873	We show that expression of cyclin E-CDK2 in murine fibroblasts causes phosphorylation of the CDK inhibitor p27Kip1 on T187, and that cyclin E-CDK2 can directly phosphorylate p27 T187 in vitro.

In brain and muscle of Cdk5 null mice, Pctaire1 activity is significantly reduced Pctaire1 interacts with p35, both in vitro and in vivo, and that phosphorylation of Pctaire1 by Cdk5 enhances its kinase activity.
SEN:10021610	10859164	CHK1 heterozygosity modestly enhances the tumorigenesis phenotype of WNT-1 transgenic mice. Chk1 plays an essential role in the mammalian DNA damage checkpoint, embryonic development, and tumor suppression
SEN:10021614	10553070	This finding agrees with previous studies that showed that IkBa is a better substrate for the IKKs than IkBb (17). The kinetics of IkBa and IkBb phosphorylation were coincident with the degradation of endogenous IkBa as well as the appearance of DNA-binding NF-kB complexes in the nucleus at approximately 15â30 min (Fig. 1B, bottom three panels).

SEN:10021644	11684709	EGF-R causes disassembly of hemidesmosomes by activating Fyn, which in turn phosphorylates the beta4 cytoplasmic domain. Neoplastic cells expressing dominant negative Fyn display increased hemidesmosomes and migrate poorly in vitro in response to EGF.

SEN:10021652	11457715	The EGF effect depended on activation of its receptor tyrosine kinase but not on that of protein kinase C, mitogen-activated protein kinases, or phosphoinositide-3 kinase.
SEN:10021654	20153347	As shown in Figs. 6B and C, acrolein induced 5-LO expression was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by pretreatment with AG1478...These results indicate that acrolein increased 5-LO expression through activation of the EGFR pathway.

SEN:10021662	11350938	since in PKR-null MEFs there is a marked defect in Erk1 and Erk2 activation by PDGF (Figure1D), it appears that PKR is involved in serine phosphorylation of Stat3 through the activation of Erks.
SEN:10021664	11350938	Whereas PKR+/+ cells exhibited a clear induction in phospho-Ser727 Stat3, PKR-null cells were defective in this process (Figure1B)
SEN:10021666	11350938	Accordingly, nuclear extracts prepared from PDGF-treated PKR- null cells were severely deficient in Stat3 containing DNA-binding complexes compared with wild-type MEFs (data not shown). Taken together, we conclude that PDGF-induced activation of Stat3 DNA binding is PKR dependent.
SEN:10021668	12588811	The extensive beta-cell death in PERK-/- islets appears to be caused by the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER, as suggested by abnormal ER morphology in PERK-/- cells (10).

SEN:10023788	10194465	Recently, b1 integrins have also been reported to enhance IRS-1 phosphorylation and interaction, but not glucose transport, with downstream molecules such as PI3-kinase and Akt (74). These results suggest that integrins and insulin/IGF-1 receptor signaling pathways converge at an early point in the signaling cascade around the IRS proteins.
SEN:10023796	11337499	As JunD/ eb1 homodimers are strong stimulators of TIMP-1 gene transcription, the most likely explanation for the inhibitory effects of exogenously added Fra2 and FosB is that they form heterodimers with endogenous JunD that are less active than JunD homodimers.

SEN:10024618	10080909	It has been difficult to interpret the physiologic role of STAT signaling in megakaryocyte development. In multiple cell lines it was reported that TPO induced activation of both STAT3 and STAT5 (5A and 5B) (26, 28?30, 37, 38)....However, when purified murine megakaryocyte extracts were examined, we found that STAT3 was much more pronounced in both tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity than STAT5 (32)

SEN:10024912	12897202	PEG-ADA therapy did, however, cause a modest decrease in mucin secretion into BAL fluid as assessed by immunoblot analysis (Figure 10).
SEN:10024916	16936205	One of the mechanisms through which adiponectin exerts such effects involves an increase in fatty acid oxidation in muscle and liver.
SEN:10024924	14683455	In muscle and liver, adiponectin activated AMP kinase and PPARalpha pathways thereby increasing beta-oxidation of lipids, leading to decreased TG content, which ameliorated insulin resistance under a high-fat diet.
SEN:10024926	18555587	gAd induced the phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 in RAW264 cells. In addition, the gAd-induced phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 was dramatically reduced by PD98059 and U0126, respectively.

SEN:10024984	19158396	As shown in Figure 6A, the kinetic of EGTA-dependent detachment was much slower in T-FGM AhR-/- cells than in their wild-type counterparts. Similar results were obtained when AhR-/- and AhR-/- MEFs were compared, although, similarly to the cell spreading experiments, the differences with respect to wild-type cells were less pronounced than in the case of the immortalized T-FGM cell line (Figure 6B).
SEN:10024988	19158396	We have shown previously that immortalized mouse fibroblasts lacking AhR expression (T-FGM AhR-/- cells) had impaired migration rates (Mulero-Navarro et al., 2005).
SEN:10024992	19158396	However, pull-down assays using a PAK-CRIB-GST fusion protein revealed that T-FGM AhR-/- cells had reduced levels of activated GTP-Rac1 compared with wildtype T-FGM fibroblasts (Figure 7A, left).
SEN:10024994	19158396	These experiments showed that T-FGM AhR-/- did have higher levels of GTP-bound RhoA than the wild-type cells (Figure 7A, right), indicating that the former cell line has higher levels of RhoA activity than the latter one.

SEN:10025030	12353028	Harlequin (Hq) mutant mice have progressive degeneration of terminally differentiated cerebellar and retinal neurons. We have identified the Hq mutation as a proviral insertion in the apoptosis-inducing factor (Aif) gene, causing about an 80% reduction in AIF expression. Mutant cerebellar granule cells are susceptible to exogenous and endogenous peroxide-mediated apoptosis, but can be rescued by AIF expression.
SEN:10025032	11259394	Overexpression of a mutant AIF protein in which the MLS has been deleted (AIF Delta 1-100) results in the primary cytosolic accumulation of AIF. AIF Delta 1-100-induced cell death is suppressed by neither Z-VAD.fmk or by Bcl-2. Thus, extramitochondrially targeted AIF is a dominant cell death inducer.
SEN:10025036	12353028	AIF is a mitochondrial oxidoreductase that translocates to the nucleus leading to nuclear condensation and apoptosis18. In addition to its role in inducing apoptosis, AIF has a potent redox function in vitro, which is separable from its apoptogenic activity20.

In fast-twitch gastrocnemius muscles lacking AK1 the MYF5 transcript level was increased by more than 200%
SEN:10025054	12562761	Whereas signals of myogenin transcripts could not be reliably detected, the MyoD mRNA level tended to be up-regulated (73% with low significance p < 0.09; n = 4).

SEN:10025660	14607781	A more thorough analysis of Cav-1 null mice revealed that, whereas a caveolin-1 deficiency did not lead to an overt diabetic phenotype, it did result in abnormalities in lipid homeostasis, characterized by resistance to diet induced obesity, ablation of the hypodermal fat layer, progressive white adipose tissue atrophy, and hypertrophy of brown adipose tissue (58).
SEN:10025670	18323531	Increased p38b expression was observed in cav-1-/- cells and tissue (Figure 6C and data not shown).

SEN:10025752	15661853	Pharmacological and genetic studies provide evidence that the expression of cyclin G1, not cyclin G2, is regulated by progesterone via its nuclear receptor. Furthermore, the expression of these genes is aberrantly up-regulated in homeo box A-10 mutant uteri, suggesting that cyclin G1 and cyclin G2 genes act as downstream targets of homeobox A-10 and negatively impact uterine cell proliferation.

SEN:10025892	18268536	Recently reported in A431 cells, this can occur through E-cadherin-mediated inhibition of transphosphorylation on Tyr845EGF-R (Perrais et al., 2007), the site, which catalyzes EGF-induced mitogenesis (Ishizawar and Parsons, 2004).

SEN:10025912	14570040	When Notch-IC is present, however, it competes with the inhibitory proteins to bind to CSL. Notch1-IC also directly stimulates expression of the cell-cycle regulator Waf1 (also known as Cip1 and p21) in primary mouse keratinocytes25. The increase in Waf1 concentration causes proliferating keratinocytes to withdraw from the cell cycle and helps to initiate terminal differentiation.

SEN:10026520	21085614	MKP-2 negatively regulated IL-12, IL-6 and TNF-a expression and positively regulates IL-10 confirming this hypothesis.
SEN:10026524	11095619	overexpression of either E2F1 or E2F2 in lens fiber cells was sufficient to cause cell cycle entry and subsequent apoptosis
SEN:10026528	16861343	We show that loss of E2f4 results in an impaired expansion of the fetal erythroid compartment in vivo that is associated with impaired cell cycle progression and decreased erythroid proliferation.
SEN:10026534	19033447	in isolated thick ascending limbs from wild-type mice, 1 nmol/liter endothelin-1 increased fluorescence (measure NO) by 3.81 Â± 0.46 fluorescence units/min.
SEN:10026540	23343326	Engagement of Gi- and Gq-protein-coupled ETB receptors by ET-1 led to phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and JNK1/2 and then activated transcription factor NF-?B.

SEN:10026554	12226756	Upon stimulation with EGF (0.3 ng/ml) or bFGF (0.3 ng/ml) about 20% of uninjected EGFR/ErbB-2 cells entered S phase (data not shown). We observed a similar rate of entrance into S phase when counting cells microinjected with a control antiserum (RAM, Figure 1e). Cells micro- injected with anti-RALT antibodies and stimulated with EGF progressed to S phase at a frequency which was 2.8-fold higher than control cells.
SEN:10026560	11457715	Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and heparin-binding (HB)-EGF, but not platelet-derived growth factor or insulin-like growth factor I, inhibited (125)I-ANP binding to ND-NOD and D-NOD mesangial cells, particularly in the latter.
SEN:10026570	10713051	Furthermore, the Src family kinase inhibitor, PP1, does not affect autophosphorylation of the receptor, but it does inhibit the EGF-induced mobility shift and phosphorylation of caveolin-1.
SEN:10026574	17074809	Upon EGF treatment, the phosphorylation state of Elk-1 was increased in only wild-type and JNK2-deficient cells.
SEN:10026576	7889942	Treatment of the cells with EGF or serum induces the rapid phosphorylation of an -60 kDa protein that is not detected in untransfected or quiescent cells.....Elk- I phosphopeptides can be detected that are also phosphorylated by purified ERKI in .vitro. Most of the radioactivity is contained in the set of partially overlapping peptides encompassing serines 383 and 389 (peptides 1- 4, 8 and 9).
SEN:10026578	18823499	As shown in Fig. 2a, EGF (100 ng/mL) increased the level of Cx43 phosphorylation from 5 min, to reach a maximum at 60 min.
SEN:10026580	11457715	NPR-C density decreased with no change in the apparent dissociation constant, and there was also a decrease in NPR-C mRNA expression.
SEN:10026582	12402043	Using an antibody against Spry2, we showed that endogenous Spry2 becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to EGF or FGF stimulation in C2C12 cells (Fig. 4b, left) and in COS7 cells (Fig. 4b, right).

SEN:10026590	7889942	In NIH3T3HERc cells treated with EGF, activation of the corresponding reporter construct (el2CAT) - reporter containing c-fos SRE - is dependent on co-transfection of Gal-Elk.
SEN:10026594	17074809	EGF enhanced TBP mRNA levels in wildtype and Jnk2-/- cells, while no significant increase in TBP mRNA was observed upon EGF treatment of Jnk1-/- cells (Fig. 1B).
SEN:10026600	16964427	In egfr (-/-) MEF cells, UV radiation did not induce HIF-1alpha and VEGF expression, in contrast, in egfr (+/+) MEF cells, UV radiation strongly induced HIF-1alpha and VEGF expression.
SEN:10026602	12402043	When Myc-tagged mSpry2 and haemagluttinin A (HA)- tagged Grb2 were expressed in cultured cells, both molecules translocated to the ruffling membrane region in response to stimulation with FGF or EGF and colocalized there (Fig. 1c).
SEN:10026606	12556466	as long as Egr1 expression was inhibited, the proliferation rate of C2 cells was markedly reduced and then resumed as soon as Egr1 expression recovered
SEN:10026608	16439363	Egr-1 appeared to play an important role in these responses because tissue (Fig. 2A) and BAL inflammation were all significantly diminished in Tg (+) mice with null mutant Egr-1 loci (Fig. 2B).
SEN:10026614	12556466	Furthermore we also showed that Egr1 is responsible for cyclin D2overexpression in tumorigenic DU145 human prostate cells. The regulation ofthese genes by Egr1 was demonstrated using Egr1 antisense oligonucleotides thatfurther implicated Egr1 in resistance to apoptotic signals
SEN:10026618	10734128	Erg1 transcription factor directly activates the luteinizing hormone beta LHbeta subuit promoter, and female mice lacking Egr1 are infertile due to LHbeta deficiency
SEN:10026622	18223159	Reynolds et al. (137) investigated the expression of Egr-1 (early growth response gene 1) in NZW and AKR mice. Egr-1 gene induces IL-1b and TNFa, cytokines that contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells after smoke exposure.
SEN:10026624	16439363	Egr-1 did, however, play a critical role in the activation of TGF-B1 because the ability of IL-13 to activate TGF-B1 was markedly diminished in comparisons of BAL fluids from Tg (+) mice with wild type and null mutant Egr-1 loci (Fig. 8B).
SEN:10026626	10734128	EGR target genes include bFGF, TGFbeta1, tissue factor, several Hox genes, platelet-derived growth factor A and B, Fas ligand and LHbeta

SEN:10026642	14749731	To investigate this issue, the two pathways were dissected following the induction of the expression of PKRwt in NIH3T3 PKRwt cells. These inducible cells undergo apoptosis upon PKR expression without the requirement for dsRNA (DonzeÂ´ et al, 1999).
SEN:10026644	12588811	PKR is required for poly IC- and poly IC plus interferon gamma (IFNg)-induced islet cell apoptosis, implicating a role of PKR in the etiology of type 1 diabetes (43).

SEN:10026648	11350938	PDGF treatment induced two Tyr705-phosphorylated forms of Stat3 in PKR+/+ cells, a faster migrating species termed Stat3fm and a slower migrating species termed Stat3sm (Figure1A).....Importantly, PDGF treatment did not induce either form of tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat3 in PKR-null cells (Figure1A), implicating a requirement for PKR in both tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of Stat3.
SEN:10026650	11350938	The results (Figure4A and B) showed a 16-fold induction in PKR wild-type cells in contrast to a 0.8-fold induction in c-fos message in PKR-null cells at 15 min of PDGF treatment
SEN:10026658	20072654	The promoter activity of a p53 downstream gene, Bax, was also upregulated more in MEFGCN2-/- andMEFPERK-/-cells than in MEF WT and MEF A/A cells (Figure 3D).
SEN:10026660	16124869	The expression of CHOP, previously shown to be positively regulated by PERK in response to thapsigargin [20,39], was significantly reduced in Perk-/- MEFs by both microarray and RT-PCR analysis (results not shown).
SEN:10026662	20072654	Our data showed that p53 transcriptional activity was up to 4.0 Â± 0.5- and 4.4 Â± 0.8-folds in MEF PERK-/- and MEF GCN2-/- cells, whereas the activity was only up to 1.4 Â± 0.1- and 1.7 Â± 0.1-folds in MEF WT and MEFA/A cells, respectively, in hypoxia (Figure 3C).
SEN:10026670	12588811	In accordance with the hypoglycemia in S51A mutant mice, the activity of PEPCK enzyme is significantly reduced (11).

SEN:10026676	20338999	FIGURE 3. eIF2a phosphorylation during hypertonic stress induces translational inhibition of Bcl-xL mRNA.
SEN:10026706	12080085	To identify the modified residue, the relevant tryptic peptides from each sample were further analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. Comparison of the fragment patterns revealed that Asn 851 contained the additional oxygen atom (Fig. 4B). Together these data show that FIH-1 is an asparaginyl hydroxylase that inhibits HIF transcriptional activity by preventing CAD association with the coactivator p300.
SEN:10026710	12118063	EphB1/Fc induced endothelial ephrin-B1 tyrosine phosphorylation, migration and integrin-mediated (alpha(v)beta(3) and alpha(5)beta(1)) attachment and promoted neovascularization, in vivo, in a mouse corneal micropocket assay.

SEN:10026734	15365177	Figure 3. (C and D) Down-regulation of IL-18 mRNA expression by IL-1{alpha} (C) and EP (D) in primary keratinocytes.
SEN:10026736	16182244	rmEP reduced IL-18 expression in WT- and EP â/â-derived keratinocytes at 8 h after stimulation, and there was no obvious difference between WT and EP â/â (Fig. 3D).
SEN:10026738	14729966	We have shown previously that ERF is phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo by Erks at multiple sites. This phosphorylation determines its cytoplasmic localization and inactivation.....ERF nuclear export is dependent on extensive phosphorylation and is a CRM1-dependent process.
SEN:10026742	12588811	overexpression of IRE1 has been shown to induce apoptosis mediated partly by activation of the Janus kinase pathway (33, 34).
SEN:10026744	16680093	As shown in Fig 4A, overexpression of IRE1a activates JNK in WT fibroblast cells, but not in TNFR1-/- cells.
SEN:10026754	15592500	The reduction in Ero1-La caused a significant inhibition of cell proliferation, evidenced by a two-fold decrease in cells in the S phase and in the G2 phase.
SEN:10026756	19752026	Cholesterol induced apoptosis was partially suppressed in Chop-/- macrophages transduced with control adeno-LacZ, which is consistent with our previous data (Feng et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2008), but apoptosis was not suppressed in cholesterol-loaded Chop-/- macrophages transduced with Ero1a.
SEN:10026758	17452443	The reduction in Ero1-L{alpha} expression had no significant effect on synthesis of adiponectin or actin or secretion of adipsin, but it did significantly reduce the amount of adiponectin secreted from the cells (Fig. 7, compare lanes 1 to 3 with lane 4).
SEN:10026760	15592500	This reduction in Ero1-La led to a significant reduction in the constitutive amount of VEGF secreted to the medium (Figure 6b).
SEN:10026768	12226756	We conclude that endogenous RALT protein behaves as a bonafide feedback inhibitor of the ErbB-2 kinase.

SEN:10026782	21372295	Knockdown of Ets-1 in WT-EC (70+/-3% reduction at Ets-1 protein level, n=4, P<0.05) abolished LPC- and TNFa-mediated VCAM-1 and MCP-1 mRNA expression (Figure 5B), suggesting that Ets-1 plays an important role in LPC/TNFa-mediated synthesis of VCAM-1 and MCP-1 downstream of PYK2.
SEN:10026784	14678752	As shown in Fig. 7A, most cells undergoing Ets2 overexpression induced apoptosis (as judged from the condensed and fragmented appearance of the nuclei (Fig. 7B)) display activation of caspase-3.
SEN:10026804	15302675	Concentrations of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were elevated in BAL fluid from thrombin-treated mice, and a TNF-alpha-neutralising antibody inhibited the influx of neutrophils in response to thrombin.
SEN:10026808	20971733	In PAR-2-/- mice, both the extent and severity of fibrotic lesions are reduced, whereas myofibroblast differentiation is diminished and collagen expression is decreased.
SEN:10026812	11350732	mice embryos deficient in tissue factor have an impaired pattern of extraembryonic angiogenesis and VWF increases endothelial cell activation
SEN:10026820	18511927	PPAR-gamma activity was elevated in A-FABP-/- macrophages with stimulation of downstream targets including LXR-alpha and ABCA1, resulting in enhanced efflux of cholesterol
SEN:10026824	18511927	It has also been demonstrated that A-FABP deficiency results in reduction in the activity of the inhibitor of kappa kinase (IKK)-nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway
SEN:10026836	20354226	However, TNF-induced necrosis is inhibited in Fadd-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (49).
SEN:10026840	16474425	FADD-/- fibroblasts are defective in type I IFN induction that is independent of IFN signaling [57].
SEN:10026846	19920354	Indeed, we found that tumors from Fap-null mice compared with those from Fap wild-type mice and tumors from mice treated with PT630 but not with LAF237 compared with those from vehicle controlâtreated mice showed an increase in phospho-FAK Tyr397 and phospho-ERK (p44/42)
SEN:10026848	12023955	Finally, reconstitution of Stat6-deficient splenic B cells with Bcl-xL was able to protect those cells from Fas-induced cell death. These results suggest that the anti-apoptotic activity of IL-4 in B cells is mediated through the activation of Stat6 and subsequent transcription of Bcl-xL.
SEN:10026850	11457890	Fas ligand-deficient generalized lymphoproliferative disease mutant (gld) mice did not develop silicosis. The gld mice had markedly reduced neutrophil extravasation into bronchoalveolar space, and did not show increased TNF-alpha production, nor pulmonary inflammation
SEN:10026880	11790801	In addition to oncogenic Ras (Oft et al., 1996), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/scatter factor (SF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and TGF alone induce mesenchymal features in diverse epithelial cell systems (Brinkmann et al., 1995; Piek et al., 1999; Thiery and Chopin, 1999).
SEN:10026888	10640391	These data demonstrate that the heparin-binding specificities of intact TSP1 and peptides from the type 1 repeats overlap with that of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) and are consistent with the ability of these TSP1-derived molecules to inhibit FGF2-stimulated angiogenesis.
SEN:10026890	12857959	IL-18 is a novel inhibitor of angiogenesis, sufficiently potent to supress tumor growth by directly inhibiting fibroblast growth factor 2 induced endothelial cell proliferation
SEN:10026892	15179029	transgenic mice show that overexpression of Sdc4 in cardiac myocytes had a significant increase in NO release and more pronouced vasodilation in the coronary elleuent in response to bFGF
SEN:10026896	16940428	recent studies showed that syndecan-4, a non-tyrosine kinase transmembrane protein also funcrions as an FGF receptor
SEN:10026898	10896947	FGF-2 (>/=10(-12) m) up-regulated the phosphorylation of cellular proteins, including p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, and increased the kinase activity of immunoprecipitated FGFR1 in mouse osteoclasts.
SEN:10026900	12604616	These data indicate that adenovirus-mediated expression of mSef reduced FGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FGFR without affecting the overall level of FGFR expression (Fig.4 A).
SEN:10026904	10511312	We show here that fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) all induce p21 expression in mouse fibroblasts, but with markedly different kinetics.
SEN:10026914	16690027	FGF-BP1 is an extracellular matrix bound protein that enhances fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling.
SEN:10026918	16204026	We previously reported that compared with Fhit+/+ cells, Fhit-/- cells with an overactivated ATR/CHK1 pathway show increased mutation frequency and resistance to DNA damage-induced killing, indicating that Fhit and the CHK1 pathway have opposing roles in cells responding to DNA damage.
SEN:10026928	14612567	We further confirmed FKBP mediated up-regulation of Sdc1 mRNA levels (Table 2) and down-regulation of MMP9 by stably overexpressing Fkbp1a or Fkbp8 in B16-F10 cells

SEN:10026962	16484683	We have used siRNA approaches to show that Fra-1 expression is critical to the expression of genes, such as cd44 and c-met, that are critical to migration and autocrine growth factor production in transformation and invasion of mesotheliomas (13).
SEN:10026970	18660816	Both mRNA and protein levels of Mrp2 and Mrp4 were decreased in the livers of Foxa2-mutant mice on both standard chow and cholic acidâenriched feed (Fig. 3a,b).
SEN:10026972	18660816	Furthermore, the induction of Mrp3 normally seen in livers of mice fed a cholic acidâsupplemented diet was blunted in the absence of Foxa2 (Fig. 3a,b).
SEN:10026974	18660816	mRNA levels of two isoforms of Mdr1, an alternative bile acid transporter23, were increased in Foxa2 mutants (significantly (P < 0.02)
SEN:10026976	18660816	Strikingly, maximal activation of Shp transcription also occurs in Foxa2-deficient mice on standard chow (Fig. 1c).
SEN:10027000	15136151	By cDNA expression array analysis and RNase protection assay, the Tbx family of transcription factors such as Tbx2, 3, 4, and 5 which, like Foxf1, are expressed in the lung mesenchyme (Chapman et al., 1996) were found to be diminished in Foxf1+/- mutant background (Kalinichenko et al., 2001b), implicating the potential role of Foxf1 in the transcriptional regulation of Tbx genes.
SEN:10027030	19033457	Consistent with diminished numbers of squamous type I cells in epFoxm1-/- lungs, mRNA levels of T1-alpha and aquaporin 5 were significantly decreased as demonstrated by quantitative real-time (RT-PCR) (qRT-PCR) analysis (Fig. 3B).
SEN:10027038	19033457	Significantly decreased mRNA levels of M-phase-promoting Cdc25B phosphatase (Fig. 3B), a known transcriptional target of Foxm1 (15), were observed in the lungs of epFoxm1-/- mice.

SEN:10027046	11815629	Using antibodies specific for cleaved caspase-3 and -7, their activation was analyzed after cytokine withdrawal (and FKHR-L1 activation). Caspase-3 (Fig. 4 A, top) and -7 (Fig. 4 A, middle) were both cleaved after cytokine withdrawal.
SEN:10027048	11815629	Both IL-3 withdrawal (Fig. 4 C, left) and forkhead activity (Fig. 4 C, right) resulted in PARP cleavage with kinetics similar to caspase activation. (Western Blot)
SEN:10027052	11815629	Both cytokine withdrawal and FKHR-L1 activation resulted in an upregulation of p27KIP1 and Bim. (Western Blot).
SEN:10027058	19342884	Unlike IL6, LIF supported expression of Foxp3, the Treg lineage transcription factor, and LIF opposed IL6 by suppressing IL-6-induced IL-17A protein release.
SEN:10027060	18368049	Forced expression of wild-type mouse Foxp3 inhibited IL-6/IL-21-induced Il23r expression, whereas Foxp3DeltaEx2 had less inhibitory activity (Fig. 4a)
SEN:10027064	15100250	Analysis of Smad7 mRNA levels showed Smad7 induction upon TGF-{beta} stimulation in control-transfected cells while overexpression of Foxp3 completely abrogated TGF-{beta}-induced Smad7 expression in CD4+ T cells (Fig. 5A).
SEN:10027066	18368049	Both mouse and human Foxp3 blocked RORgammat-directed IL-17 expression, but full suppression required the presence of the exon 2-encoded sequence in Foxp3, suggesting that the interaction between Foxp3 and RORgammat is essential (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 5).
SEN:10027068	22461430	Compared with wild-type mice, Fpr1 knockout mice displayed marked decreases in the lung migration of neutrophils and macrophages after CS exposure.
SEN:10027070	11447289	We have previously demonstrated that complex formation between the SH2 domain of Grb2 and FRS2a is mediated via Y196-, Y306-, Y349-, and Y392-designated Grb2 binding sites (4, 5).
SEN:10027072	11447289	In addition, FRS2a recruits Grb2 indirectly by means of two binding sites for the SH2 domains of the protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 at Y436- and Y471-designated Shp2 binding sites (5).
SEN:10027084	19005493	It is thought that ADAM17 maturation (activation by the cleavage of the propeptide by proprotein convertases, such as furin and PC7) occurs during transit or on arrival at the cell surface (FIG. 4a), and this may be similar for other ADAMs.
SEN:10027088	18536717	By contrast, reexpression of Fzd2 in Gata6 flox/flox:Sftpc-cre mutant lungs by electroporation of a Fzd2 expression plasmid led to a substantial increase in SP-C expression (Fig. 5m).
SEN:10027092	21743011	Administration of 1.99.25 inhibited physiological and pathologic sprouting angiogenesis within the retina
SEN:10027096	14676846	The deficiency of Cks1 in TGF-beta-treated cells likely contributes to the stabilization of Kip1 protein and destabilization of Skp2, because in the absence of Cks1, SCFSkp2 cannot ubiquitinate Kip1 protein; instead, self-ubiquitination of Skp2 occurs.
SEN:10027098	20032314	Inhibition of G6PD with siRNA led to increased ROS and apoptosis, decreased proliferation, and impaired insulin secretion.
SEN:10027106	16772293	Furthermore Gadd45a was demonstrated to strongly inhibit Aurora-A kinase activity and to antagonize Aurora-A-induced centrosome amplification.
SEN:10027112	14647429	While most beta-catenin protein is localized to the cell membrane and is involved in cell-cell adhesion, accumulation of free cytoplasmic beta-catenin will translocate into the nucleus where it functions in a bipartite transcription factor complex, whose targets include invasion and metastasis promoting endopeptidases, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP).

SEN:10027144	17272506	Gfi1b mRNA was decreased approximately 3-fold 48 hours after infection of lymphomas with Gata3siRNA virus (Figure 7A). To further test the ability of Gata3 to promote Gfi1b mRNA expression we used a Gata3-producing retrovirus to ectopically express Gata3 protein (Figure 7C). Gata3 induced Gfi1b mRNA by 12- or 6-fold over control virus-infected cells in 1.F9 or 0531 lymphomas, respectively (Figure 7D).
SEN:10027148	15542856	In contrast to Sox7, exogenous expression of Gata-4 or Gata-6 induced the expression of laminin alpha1 and Hnf1b in undifferentiated F9 and F9H1Sox7 cells without RA/Bt2cAMP treatment (Fig. 5 and 6 ).
SEN:10027152	10318839	Within the proximal A1AR promoter, putative binding sites for cardiac transcription factors GATA and Nkx2.5 were identified.

SEN:10027774	17303558	from full text - Similarly, we find that both b-arrestin1 and 2 are ubiquitinated in IGF-1-stimulated WT MEF cells.
SEN:10027782	11145585	At the doses tested, IGF-I restored CHOP induction by amino acid deprivation, but EGF did not (Fig. 2B), indicating that IGF-I can substitute for the serum requirement.
SEN:10027792	11486081	We found that IGF-1 blocked the transcriptional activation of 24p3 that normally occurs after IL-3 withdrawal (Fig. 6C, lane 2 versus 3). These results strongly suggest that IGF-1 promotes survival after IL-3 withdrawal by inhibiting 24p3 transcriptional activation. Direct addition of 24p3 bypasses this transcriptional block, and therefore IGF-1 has no effect
SEN:10027794	12122065	We found that myelin staining, MBP and PLP expression, and the percentage of oligodendrocytes and their precursors are significantly reduced in all brain regions of developing IGF-I KO mice but are similar to controls in adult IGF-I KO mice.

SEN:10027850	16940042	Thus, while IL-10 can reduce Th2 recall immune responses, its major effect evident during the primary response is to inhibit the development of Th1 responses, thereby favoring Th2 development.
SEN:10027854	11591769	IL-10 can directly promote the death of inflammatory cells, including activated macrophages (4), neutrophils (5), and T cells
SEN:10027856	16293001	Pinderski and colleagues have recently reported that a reduction in macrophage caspase3 activity in LDL-receptor null mice overexpressing IL10 most likely accounts for the decreased formation of necrotic cores within the atherosclerotic lesions of these animals, suggesting antiapoptotic and plaque-stabilizing effects of IL10 (114)
SEN:10027860	18666314	from full text - An inactivation of IL-10 in mice results in an increased production of IL-12 and IFN-gamma [42,43]. Inflamed tissues and granulomas of CD show low IL-10[44]. Melgar et al[45] reported a highly significant increase in IL-10 mRNA levels in T lymphocytes and in IL-10-positive cells in the colons of UC patients.
SEN:10027864	17332883	Although some studies suggest that IL-10 (alone or in combination with IFN-g) also functions as a repressor of the fibrotic process (97), the role of IL-10 in SSc remains to be clarified.

SEN:10027878	12393603	Overall, these results show that, in mice, GC treatment and IL-10 overproduction both stimulate GILZ production in vivo
SEN:10027880	11591769	In contrast, IL-10 increases the survival of some types of human cancer cells, such as Burkitt lymphoma (7). Non-Hodgkin s lymphoma cells secrete IL-10, and inhibition of this autocrine IL-10 has recently been shown to promote cell death and reduce expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2
SEN:10027882	11591769	Similarly, IL-10 increases the expression of Bcl-xL in thyrocytes from patients with Graves disease

SEN:10027910	12897202	By 3 months of age, adenosine concentrations in lungs from IL-13 Tg mice had increased to levels tenfold greater than those measured in wild-type lungs.
SEN:10027912	11884467	IL-13 caused an impressive increase in lung collagen (measured by hydroxyproline content assay) and BAL HA content that could be easily appreciated with the histochemical and biochemical measurement techniques (Fig. 5 and data not shown).
SEN:10027916	11884467	In the CC10-IL-13 mice, progressive lung pathology is noted. At 1 mo of age, these animals manifest peribronchial inflammation, mucus metaplasia, alveolar enlargement, and subepithelial fibrosis (10).

SEN:10027926	12091879	In animal models of allergic asthma, blockade of IL-13 markedly inhibits allergen-induced AHR, mucus production and eosinophilia. Furthermore, IL-13 delivery to the airway causes all of these effects. IL-13 is thus both necessary and sufficient for experimental models of asthma.
SEN:10027930	12091879	As expected, we found that tg-IL-13+Stat6+/- mice had substantial fibrosis as demonstrated by elevated levels of lung hydroxyproline, a constituent of collagen (Fig. 3b). This increase was dependent on STAT6 expression, but expression of hSTAT6 in epithelial cells did not result in reconstitution of the fibrotic response.
SEN:10027932	16849505	As previously reported (11), Tg IL-13 was a potent stimulator of fibrosis in Tg mice with (/) 5-LO loci (Fig. 6, A and B).
SEN:10027936	12897202	The A3 adenosine receptor was expressed diffusely in the lungs of wild-type mice (Figure 6a). In lungs from IL-13 Tg mice this receptor was expressed diffusely in the interstitium (data not shown) and in patches of inflammatory cells that encompassed eosinophils and macrophages near sites of remodeling (Figure 6b).
SEN:10027938	10072486	Among the Th2 cytokines tested, IL-13 was by far the most effective cytokine inducing eotaxin in the lung, up-regulating both the eotaxin mRNA expression and protein production (Fig. 2, AâC).
SEN:10027940	10072486	naive BALB/c mice were treated with different concentrations of IL-4 and IL-13, and eotaxin in lung tissues or in BAL were measured by ELISA...Compared with IL-13, IL-4 induced much lower levels of eotaxin even at higher doses (Fig. 4).
SEN:10027942	11884467	MCP-3, macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC), and C10 have also been demonstrated to be induced in an IL-13-dependent fashion in vivo, and IL-13 stimulates MCP-1, MDC, and eotaxin production in vitro (14, 26, 27).
SEN:10027944	11884467	Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that IL-13 is a potent stimulator of eotaxin production in vivo (10).
SEN:10027946	11884467	This was done by quantitating the levels of selected chemokines (MCP-1, MIP-1, eotaxin) in BAL...fluids from CC10-rtTA-IL-13 mice at intervals after dox administration. Rapid inductive patterns and delayed inductive patterns were noted.
SEN:10027948	16951379	IL-13 increased Egr-1 mRNA levels in a biphasic manner in Stat6/ fibroblasts; early induction of Egr-1 mRNA was observed 30 min following exposure to IL-13 and declined after 3â6 h (Fig. 6A). Egr-1 protein was increased in Stat6/ fibroblasts as compared with Stat6/ fibroblasts from 30 min to 3 h after IL-13 treatment (Fig. 6, B and C).

SEN:10028008	11067861	Interestingly, IL-13 did cause an approximately 80% decrease in pulmonary a1-AT expression (Figure 13). It also caused a significant increase in TIMP-1 expression that was seen after as little as 1 day and was readily apparent with longer periods of dox administration (Figure 13, and data not shown) (P < 0.05 for all comparisons).
SEN:10028010	11884467	As previously reported (13), IL-13 was a potent inducer of TIMP-1 and had lesser stimulatory effects on TIMP-2 and TIMP-4 while inhibiting 1-AT in wild-type animals (Fig. 7B). (RT-PCR analysis)

SEN:10028244	18955973	Following IL-3 withdrawal, c-MYC is downregulated and cells become growth arrested, accumulating in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, and rapidly undergo apoptosis. Enforced c-MYC expression accelerates the apoptotic response in the absence of IL-3 (Askew et al., 1991).
SEN:10028252	16585210	In parental Ba/F3 cells, PIM-1 mRNA expression was strictly dependent on IL-3 stimulation and decreased rapidly after IL-3 depletion.

SEN:10028258	11397944	In addition to their positive effects on TH2 and TH1 development, IL-4 (Fig. 1) and IL-12 (7, 30), acting via STAT proteins, potently suppress induction of T-bet and Gata-3, thereby limiting differentiation of TH1 and TH2 subsets, respectively.
SEN:10028260	10783130	IL-4 increases mRNA turnover of IL-1 b and TNFa in human monocytes and mouse macrophages, respectively (23, 24).
SEN:10028266	12626590	In addition to its effects on human cells, IL-4 reduced C5a receptors in murine bone marrow-derived DC and impaired recruitment of labeled bone marrow-derived DC in syngeneic BALB/c mice to i.p. injected C5a. Overall, these data suggest that inhibition of a rapid anaphylatoxin-induced mobilization of monocytes and DC to inflamed tissues represents an important anti-inflammatory activity of the Th2 cytokine IL-4.
SEN:10028268	11397944	Induction of IFN-g was clearly STAT4-independent, consistent with prior in vitro (10) and in vivo (15) findings, and, as expected (16), emergence of IFN-g expressing cells was markedly limited by IL-4 signaling. Combinations of neutralizing antibodies and cytokines further confirmed the specificity of these pathways (17).
SEN:10028276	16547273	To verify the absence of the STAT6-signaling cascade in STAT6-/- MLF, we assessed mOSM and mIL-4 induced responses with respect to STAT3 and STAT6 activation. Fig. 6 confirms the absence of STAT6 protein and STAT6 induction in STAT6-/- MLF but equivalent activation of STAT3 in both wt and STAT6-/- MLF.
SEN:10028280	11397944	Induction of T-bet was, however, suppressed by IL-4 (Fig. 1D) acting via STAT6 (17). Thus, T-bet expression and TH1 differentiation are coordinately induced without requiring IL-12/STAT4 and are coordinately suppressed by IL-4/STAT6.

In both models, skeletal muscle was insulin resistant when studied in vitro.
SEN:10028480	18587407	Hepatic insulin resistance also decreases expression of the bile acid synthetic enzymes, particularly Cyp7b1, and produces partial resistance to the farnesoid X receptor, leading to a lithogenic bile salt profile.

SEN:10028748	17299132	It is reported that KRasG12D-induced lung tumors do not routinely display elevated pERK1/2 but display stress-activated MAP kinase (SAPK/JNK) activation (Lee et al. 2002)... Interestingly, the major difference appears to be that expression of KRasG12D in the lung leads to more rapid and consistent progression to adenocarcinoma than that elicited by BRafVE.
SEN:10028764	15284181	Constitutively active mutant K-ras(V12) in E10 cells led to a highly significant (P < 0.001) increased level of peroxides, and a corresponding increase in the amount of DNA strand-break damage, compared with the parental line E10 and the vector control
SEN:10028766	17468755	Expression of KrasG12V induced also a loss of epithelial markers (as assessed by E-cadherin staining, which was similar in Mapk14D/+ and Mapk14D/D alveoli; Fig. 6c) and an increase in SP-C+ cells (Fig. 6d).

SEN:10028836	15579447	In addition, we obtained cells from the lungs and the spleen from the OVA-challenged mice and cultured them in the presence of OVA. We noted that cells from gal3-/- mice produced significantly higher amounts of IFN-g (a Th1 cytokine) and lower amounts of IL-4 (a Th2 cytokine), compared to gal3+/+ mice (data not shown). The results suggest that gal3-/- mice have lower Th2 but higher Th1 responses compared to gal3+/+ mice.

Galectin-9-induced intracellular calcium flux, aggregation and death of T(H)1 cells were Tim-3-dependent in vitro, and administration of galectin-9 in vivo resulted in selective loss of interferon-gamma-producing cells and suppression of T(H)1 autoimmunity.
SEN:10028858	16286920	According to our confocal image data, there were apoptotic bodies and necrotic-like cells present during galectin-9-induced cell death, suggesting the possible involvement of apoptotic and necrotic cell death. Similarly, galectin-2 can induce both necrosis and apoptosis23.

SEN:10028908	10884287	As expected, mRNA levels for LPL were reduced in fld white adipose tissue, as were those of adipsin. We also found that uncoupling protein 1 mRNA in brown adipose tissue from fld mice was reduced.
SEN:10028914	19742316	About a two-fold increase of PDGFRb expression was detected in smLRP1-/- mice regardless of LDLR genotype (Figure 2A, C). Increased Erk1/2 phosphorylation was also observed in these aortas (Figure 2A). These data suggest that the expression and activation of PDGFRb is only regulated by LRP1, not LDLR.
SEN:10028918	19742316	Studies from our laboratory have shown that LRP1 suppresses PDGF receptor b (PDGFRb) activation and protects against atherosclerosis.

SEN:10028942	20226760	The supernatants from cultured LN cells were also collected and the production of various cytokines (TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-6, and IL-17) was measured (Fig. 3B). The cytokine levels in BLT1-/- cells were significantly lower than those in BLT1+/+ cells
SEN:10028944	17615396	Furthermore, LTBP-4-deficient mice also had evidence of activated bone morphogenic protein-4 (BMP-4) signaling, which might have contributed to the lung phenotype (159)
SEN:10028952	20139367	alpha-LTbetaR also induced RelA translocation to the nucleus, albeit to a lesser extent, but predominantly induced nuclear translocation of RelB at late time points (Figure 1B, right).
SEN:10028954	20139367	Electrophoretic mobility shift assay supershift analysis confirmed TNF-induced RelA but not RelB NF-bB binding within 30 minutes (Figure 1C, left). In contrast, a-LTbR induced both RelA and RelB complexes, although with slower kinetics (Figure 1C, right).

SEN:10028958	17486074	Mammalian two-hybrid analysis and luciferase assay suggested that excess LYL1 blocked the dimerization of E2A and thus inhibited the regulatory activity of E2A on the CD4 promoter.
SEN:10028962	16339523	Among the cytokines expressed after 4 h of Ag stimulation in BMMCs, our data show that levels of mRNA and protein for IL-4, IL-6, and for IL-13 are all significantly higher in Lyn-/- than in WT BMMCs.
SEN:10028966	16339523	Our data show that mRNA coding for at least one transcription factor, the cytoplasmic NF-AT (NF-ATC, also known as NFATC1 and NFAT2) is induced 3-fold more in Lynâ/â BMMCs than in WT BMMCs (Table II).
SEN:10028968	16339523	The 33-fold up-regulation of sphingosine kinase 1 in Ag-stimulated Lynâ/â BMMCs may also contribute to increased chemokine production
SEN:10028972	12642482	At the 35-somite stage, there were few TUNEL-positive cells but, significantly, they were observed in the Mab21l1-/- lens placode (Fig. 6I,J). We did not see significant differences at either the 32- or 40-somite stages (data not shown). These results suggest that Mab21l1 is required for lens placode cell proliferation and for protection against apoptosis.
SEN:10028974	12642482	These results suggest that MAB21L1 function is required for the appropriate induction and subsequent maintenance of Foxe3 expression.
SEN:10028980	17158225	Given our observation that overexpression of MafB inhibits RANKL-mediated osteoclast differentiation, we examined the expression levels of NFATc1 and OSCAR, which are known to be important modulators of osteoclastogenesis.11,32 As compared to control, exogenous overexpression of MafB attenuated the expression of NFATc1 as well as OSCAR during RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis (Figure 3A).

SEN:10028990	21628326	LC3-II was increased in FoxO3MyHC cardiomyocytes after ex vivo transgene activation (Figure 4F; see Supplementary material online, Figure S6C). Treatment with lysosomal inhibitors revealed that LC3-II levels could still be stimulated in FoxO3MyHC cardiomyocytes, indicating an activation of autophagy rather than a disturbance in autophagic flux.
SEN:10028992	21151103	Compared to wild-type Map1lc3b+/+ macrophages, Map1lc3b-/- macrophages displayed a higher level of the active, cleaved (10 kDa) form of caspase-1 in response to LPS and ATP treatment (Fig. 1a).
SEN:10029002	12374793	TGF-beta1 selectively activated the p38 MAPK isoforms p38alpha and p38delta in wild-type (Mkk3+/+) mesangial cells MKK3 deficiency resulted in a selective disruption of TGF-beta1-stimulated up-regulation of pro-alpha1(I) collagen expression
SEN:10029004	15039780	Moreover, genetic inactivation of MKK4 in MEFs resulted in reduced proliferation doubling times and premature senescence, indicating that both MKK4 and MKK7 are essential for these cellular processes (data not shown).

SEN:10029016	15039780	Importantly, cyclin B1-associated CDC2 kinase activity was markedly reduced in mkk7-/- MEFs (Fig. 4d), indicating that reduced CDC2 expression correlates with impaired cyclin B1/CDC2 activity.
SEN:10029022	15039780	Similarly to mkk7-/- MEFs, cdc2 mRNA expression was downregulated in primary mkk7-/- hepatocytes (Fig. 4g).

SEN:10029058	19454702	p38-/- MEF exhibited a 2-fold increase of intracellular ROS levels in comparison to p38+/+ MEF (Fig. 9, A and B).
SEN:10029060	17468755	However, the SP-C+ cells were more numerous in the Mapk14-/- lungs (with almost twice as many as in Mapk14-/+ lungs; Fig. 2c). Notably, immunohistological staining showed reduced levels of the epithelial marker E-cadherin in the alveolar cells (Fig. 2c), indicating defective differentiation of these cells.
SEN:10029062	17468755	Notably, we found that p38a-deficient lungs contained lower levels of C/EBPa and HNF3b, another transcription factor involved in lung differentiation whose expression is controlled by C/EBPa (ref. 19) (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 1a online).
SEN:10029064	19454702	As demonstrated in Fig. 8A, ERK was strongly phosphorylated in p38â/â MEF, but not in p38+/+ MEF.
SEN:10029066	17468755	Furthermore, the higher number of AT2 cells correlated with an almost fivefold increase in Ki67+ cells in Mapk14-/- lungs compared with the number of Ki67+ cells in their heterozygous Mapk14D/+ counterparts (Fig. 2d).
SEN:10029068	17468755	We also detected a reduction in STAT3 protein in Mapk14D/D lungs (Fig. 3a) that correlated with the reduction in Il6 mRNA (Fig. 3).

SEN:10029072	17468755	three times as much Egfr mRNA was present in Mapk14D/D lungs (Fig. 3d) compared with Mapk14D/+ lungs, suggesting that EGFR expression was transcriptionally enhanced in the absence of p38a.

SEN:10029080	19454702	Nrf2 levels were higher in nuclear fractions of p38â/â MEF compared with those in p38+/+ MEF and Nrf2 was hardly detectable in the cytoplasmic fractions (Fig. 5). However, only minor differences were observed for total Nrf2 levels
SEN:10029082	17468755	Notably, EGFR transcription is regulated by AP-1 (ref. 28), and we observed higher levels of phospho-c-Jun, one of the AP-1 components, in the p38a-deficient lungs (Fig. 3c), suggesting that p38a downregulation might activate AP-1.
SEN:10029098	15039780	These results are consistent with previous data showing that loss of JNK1/JNK2 in MEFs results in reduced proliferation17 and that inactivation of c-Jun in MEFs results in premature senescence and impaired proliferation19.

SEN:10029184	18385967	incubation with the neutralizing MIF antibody inhibited the serum-induced proliferation of SMCs, suggesting a possible autocrine response SMC-derived MIF which contributes to the mitogenic effect of serum stimulation [21].
SEN:10029186	16272275	Treatment of a strain of mice, which spontaneously develop atherosclerotic lesions (apolipoprotein E-deficient mice) with neutralizing anti-MIF Ab, led to a reduction of a variety of inflammatory mediators typically associated with atherosclerosis (32), implying that MIF may also play an important role in arterial intima inflammation.
SEN:10029188	18385967	In MIF?/? mice, endotoxin-treated macrophages showed decreased viability, reduced proinflammatory function, and increased apoptosis [37].
SEN:10029204	18791328	Use of antisense MIF led to decreased MIF concentrations in treated macrophages while higher amounts of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase and lower concentrations of cytokines such as TNF were observed. This study thus demonstrated the proinflammatory potential of MIF and stressed the importance of an autocrine action of MIF to override steroid-induced MKP-1 and to inhibit cytokine production [29] .

SEN:10029248	19706765	After 10 to 15 weeksof doxycycline treatment, the bitransgenic mice began to develop adenomatoid hyperplasia in both parenchyma and small conducting airways(F ig. 2A, +Dox 10W), which resembles to the histopathologic feature of dysplasia in clinical lesions.
SEN:10029250	19706765	In addition, Stat3-induced downstream developmental gene HNF4a wasup-regulated to 78.6-fold, Foxa3 to 9.3-fold, and SHH to 3.3-fold (Fig. 4D).

SEN:10029254	18223159	who showed that neutrophil elastase activates pro-MMP-12 and destroys tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease (TIMP)-1; conversely, MMP-12 degrades A1AT.
SEN:10029258	20181883	Although the TIMP and Th2 cytokine responses were similar, a marked and highly significant increase in MMP13 was observed in the lungs of mmp12-/- mice after egg challenge (Fig. 4A).
SEN:10029260	19706765	increased expression of several other MMPs was also observed in doxycycline-treated bitransgenic mice compared with untreated mice. (Fig 4D)
SEN:10029268	19668337	Time-lapse microscopy revealed that the Mmp7-/- epithelium appeared to retain the ability to spread over the wound, as these cells formed extended lamellipodial fronts soon after wounding. However, only WT epithelium continued to migrate and complete the wound healing process.
SEN:10029270	20135274	Mmp7-/- mice have been used to identify or at least highly implicate FasL, syndecan-1 , E-cadherin, RANKL , latent TNF-a , elastin , and notch-1 as substrates of MMP7
SEN:10029272	19668337	Moreover, shed syndecan-1 was detected in the medium of injured WT cultures and in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from naphthalene injured WT mice but not in Mmp7?/? samples (Figure 1C).

SEN:10029294	12242286	Myostatin appears to function by controlling myoblast cell cycle progression (35). Recombinant myostatin, when added to actively growing myoblasts, inhibited the progression of G1 myoblasts into S phase.
SEN:10029298	14715915	the inhibitory effect of MSTN on muscle growth is demonstrated by the hypertrophic and hyperplasic muscle phenotype displayed by MSTN-/- mice
SEN:10029300	12242286	INTRO Myostatin is a newly identified member of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily, and myostatin-null mice have been found to show a two- to threefold increase in skeletal muscle mass due to an increase in the number of muscle fibers (hyperplasia) and the size of the fibers (hypertrophy) (21).
SEN:10029308	12673834	MT-I overexpression regulated the inflammatory response, decreased oxidative stress and apoptosis significantly, and increased brain tissue repair in comparison with either GFAP-IL-6 or control litter-mate mice.
SEN:10029316	20038814	While the reduction of mTOR markedly abolished STAT3, p63, and Notch signaling (Figure 9A), decreased expression of rictor did not affect the STAT3/p63/Notch signaling cascade (Figure 9B).
SEN:10029318	19390566	Furthermore, the inactivation of mTOR decreases IL-2 secretion upon stimulation of DCs through the C-type lectin receptor Dectin [138], indicating that cytokine production through C-type lectin receptor activation involves mTOR.

SEN:10029382	16891671	This was the first direct evidence of an atheroprotective effect of TLR deficiency. These mice had a reduction in plasma monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), an important mediator of tissue macrophage infiltration, as well as a reduction in plaque lipid content and macrophage infiltration. The same changes were found in MyD88â/âapoEâ/â mice, in accordance with Bjorkbacka et al. (42).
SEN:10029384	19293939	By using neutralizing antibody against TLR4, the releases of CCL3 and CXCL2 was decreased (Fig. 3A and B). MyD88 is a critical adapter molecule for the transduction of TLRs signals. Therefore, cDCs lacking MyD88 were investigated. CSE did not induce the release of CCL3 and CXCL2 from cDCs obtained from MyD88 knockout mice (Fig. 3C and D).
SEN:10029386	19052556	In response to hepatocyte cell death, MyD88 signalling was responsible for the activation of NF-?B and for the production of factors such as IL-6 (ReF. 122).
SEN:10029392	18852364	Deficiency of MyD88, a downstream signaling molecule of TLR4, also abolished the lipopolysaccharide response in WT and Abcg1-deficient macrophages (Figure IA and IB in the online-only Data Supplement).
SEN:10029394	12242286	Thus, the hyperplasia condition observed in the absence of myostatin could be due to increased proliferation of myoblasts because of a deregulated G1/S checkpoint (35). MyoD and Myf5 are expressed in myoblasts and myotubes and have been shown to be required for myogenesis.

SEN:10029876	12177059	Substitution of Arg-238, equivalent to conserved Arg in the 14-3-3 binding motif, with Glu (R238E) decreased 14-3-3theta binding to PDK1 (Fig. 3 C, upper panel, lane 4). In contrast, substitution of Val-243 with Pro (V243P), a residue conserved in many 14-3-3 targets, such as Raf-1 and Bad (Fig.3 A), dramatically increased the amount of 14-3-3theta bound to PDK1

SEN:10029920	18794886	Data coming from mice lacking p110a regulatory subunits have shed light on the dual role of p85 in PI3K regulation in response to insulin (Katso et al., 2001). Heterozygous deletion of either p85a or b in mice leads, surprisingly, to increased sensitivity to insulin, whereas compound heterozygous mutants fail to activate PI3K in response to insulin.
SEN:10029924	18794886	The loss of the regulatory subunit of PI3K1A, p85, results in the decrease of Pten activity in p85 liver conditional knockout mice (Barber et al., 2006).

SEN:10029936	16123140	The Pim-1 and Pim-2 transfectants have lower levels of serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity and the alpha- and beta-subunit B56gamma of the PP2A phosphatase do not coimmunoprecipitate in these cells. Thus, the effects of Pim on PP2A activity may mediate the levels of c-Myc and the phosphorylation of proteins needed for increased protein synthesis.

SEN:10030022	10542237	Devchand et al. (11) showed that absence of PPARa expression in mice prolonged the inflammatory response.
SEN:10030024	14561188	PPARa elicits most of its anti-inflammatory effects at the vascular wall by negatively interfering with the NF-kB transcriptional pathway [25,26,28,29].
SEN:10030026	14561188	The first evidence of the involvement of PPARs in inflammation came from the demonstration that PPARa absence in mice prolonged the duration of the inflammatory response [9].

SEN:10030058	17618855	Moreover, PRDM16-transduced cells expressed several of the important thermogenic genes in a cAMP-dependent manner, similar to what bona fide brown fat cells do in culture and in vivo. The mRNA levels of UCP1, deiodinase-d2 and PGC-1alpha were increased by PRDM16 in unstimulated fat cells and induced to very high levels by PRDM16 in response to cAMP
SEN:10030060	17618855	At the molecular level, expression of genes common to both white and brown fat lineages were either not affected (PPAR? and adiponectin) or moderately elevated (aP2) by PRDM16 expression (Figure 2A).

SEN:10030226	11127205	the presence of Sox4 mRNA in hypertrophic chrondrocytes within the mouse epiphyseal growth plate at sites that overlap or are adjacent to target cells for TPH and PTHrP, and its strong up-regulation via activated PTH/PTHrP receptors in OHS cells, makes it a promising candidate for mediated downstream effects of PTH and PTHrP in bone
SEN:10030232	18662538	TGF? stimulates PTHrP secretion without appearing to increase PTHrP mRNA levels. PTHrP stimulates the production of RANK ligand (RANKL) in osteoblasts, which in turn promotes the differentiation of osteoclast precursors and bone resorption. Administration of anti-PTHrP neutralizing antibodies inhibits TGF?-dependent osteolytic bone metastasis in mice (Kakonen et al., 2002).

SEN:10030296	19349358	To begin to assess whether altered responses to TGFbeta may play a role in the phenotype of Rac1-deficient fibroblasts, we first used real time PCR analysis to show that Rac1-deficient fibroblasts possessed a modest, yet significant, reduction in TGFbeta2 mRNA expression (Figure 6B) suggesting that the primary defect in Rac1-deficient fibroblasts was not a defect in TGFbeta signaling.

SEN:10030728	21386907	However, the expression level of ADH1 was significantly reduced in Smad7-deleted hepatocytes under both basal and alcohol-treated conditions (Figure 6C), further indicating that Smad7 deletion can reduce AHD1 expression in the liver.
SEN:10030762	18662538	Phosphorylation of these sites in Smad1 enables the binding of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf1, which bars Smad1 interaction with nucleoporins and leads to Smad1 polyubiquitination and degradation (Sapkota et al., 2007).

SEN:10030830	15082719	By contrast, SOX2 was a poor activator of Fgf-3 transcription, and when Sox2 was coexpressed with Gata4, it negatively modulated the strong activation mediated by GATA-4....Previous studies identified GATA-4 as a transcription factor that binds the key regulatory element PS4A of the Fgf-3 promoter and stimulates transcription.
SEN:10030838	17869213	A semiquantitative score of the severity of lung fibrosis was reduced in group with the treatment of ring-type Sp1 decoy ODNs, compared with the groups with the treatment of only bleomycin and scramble decoy ODNs (Table 1).

SEN:10030916	10585467	As depicted in Fig. 4, the genes for glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, ATP citrate lyase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and S14 were markedly activated by refeeding in the wild-type mice (Fig. 4 and Table II). In contrast, these refeeding responses were severely reduced inSREBP-1 ?/? mice.
SEN:10030918	14985341	Here we demonstrate that p53 is involved in the molecular mechanisms of hepatocellular injury associated with steatosis.

SEN:10031482	11157054	However, when we submitted tracheal and lung tissue from TNF-aâtreated mice to immunohistochemistry, we found that airway epithelial cells were the predominant site of induction of IL-12 p40 expression (Fig. 3).
SEN:10031490	17082637	As shown in Fig. 9A, TNF-a strongly stimulated both ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation in WT cells (cf lanes 1 and 2).
SEN:10031492	12438440	The capacity of TNF to induce MMP expression in chondrocytes was not altered by the deficiency of c-fos, since MMP-3, MMP-9, and MMP-13 were similarly induced in hTNFtg and c-fos-/-hTNFtg mice (Table 3).
SEN:10031494	11773040	The role of TNFalpha in stimulating retinal microvascular endothelial cell (RMVEC) proteinase production was evaluated using isolated murine RMVECs...TNFalpha increased the expression (production) of MT1-MMP, MMP-3, and MMP-9
SEN:10031496	21502320	Whereas TNF-? and other cytokines up-regulate MMP-9 expression, interferons (IFNs) inhibit MMP-9 expression. We found that IFN-? treatment or forced expression of the IFN-induced GTPase, mGBP-2, inhibit TNF-?-induced MMP-9 expression in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, by inhibiting MMP-9 transcription. The NF-?B transcription factor is required for full induction of MMP-9 by TNF-?.
SEN:10031502	18263619	Genetic complementation of RelA/p65-/- cells with wild type and non-acetylatable mutants of RelA/p65 (K314R and K315R) revealed that neither shuttling, DNA binding nor the induction of anti-apoptotic genes by tumor necrosis factor alpha was affected by acetylation on these residues.

SEN:10031538	11172472	genes that are positively regulated by PPARgamma, such as adipocyte lipid-binding protein 2 (aP2) or lipoprotein lipase-(LPL). PPARgamma mRNA levels were also downregulated by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha)
SEN:10031544	9607817	a part of the H2-Ke4 genomic region (1.9-kb), as well as the 250-bp promoter, was transcriptionally active as an Rxrb promoter; TNF)-alpha significantly repressed the %activity of the 250-bp promoter
SEN:10031548	16148154	Both LPS and TNF-? increased total PAI-1 levels in RAW264.7 supernatants, and this up-regulation in PAI-1 levels was decreased in a dose-dependent manner by SP600125 pretreatment
SEN:10031560	18079962	Lack of Trailr also increased bronchopneumonia and fibrosis in lung, indicating that Trailr suppresses chronic inflammation
SEN:10031566	16680093	We also examined Bip/GRP78 expression and XBP1 protein in TNFR1-/- cells after Tg treatment. Bip/GRP78 messenger RNA level and the level of the spliced form of XBP1 protein are decreased in TNFR1-/- cells (supplementary Fig 2 online).

SEN:10031610	18411337	We show that the expression of a tumor necrosis factor receptor family member, death receptor 3 (DR3; also known as TNFRSF25), is selectively elevated in Th17 cells, and that TL1A, its cognate ligand, can promote the proliferation of effector Th17 cells.
SEN:10031614	20139367	TNF strongly induced nuclear translocation of RelA within 30 minutes, as shown by Western blotting of nuclear extracts (Figure 1B, left).

SEN:10031646	17127443	TPO is necessary for megakaryocyte maturation in that TPO deficient mice display greatly reduced megakaryocyte production as well as reduced numbers of mature megakaryocytes
SEN:10031648	18060035	In most cell types, STAT1 is primarily triggered by interferon signaling (21). However, TPO signaling phosphorylates STAT1 in WT megakaryocytes (10).
SEN:10031662	16129676	Consistent with our previous findings that TRAF2 and TRAF6 activate ASK1, H(2)O(2)-induced ASK1 activation and cell death were strongly reduced in the cells derived from Traf2-/- and Traf6-/- mice.

SEN:10031688	18155543	As shown in a number of in vivo studies using atherosclerosis-prone mice, a deficiency in p53, one of the main factors involved in senescence signaling (Fig 1), accelerates atherosclerosis development, possibly by increasing macrophage proliferation in atherosclerotic lesions.86-88
SEN:10031702	18955973	in p53-null MEFs, only Bcl-X(L) expression was suppressed, and Bcl-X(L) overexpression blocked apoptosis (Maclean et al., 2003).
SEN:10031706	18285820	Increased apoptosis and proliferative arrest of pro-B cells in Ku80/ mice were rescued by a p53-null background (Difilippantonio et al, 2000).
SEN:10031710	19898465	Whereas gain of TAp63 induces senescence, loss of p63 enhances sarcoma development in mice lacking p53.
SEN:10031712	20038814	reduction of the expression of all the p63 isoforms using pan siRNA for p63 (39, 45, 46) decreased the expression of both Jagged1 and Hes1 in WT MEFs, MEFs without Tsc1 or Tsc2, and WT MEFs expressing myrAKT1 (Figure 6B).
SEN:10031714	21949157	Gadd153 induction (~2.5-fold) was also observed in C57BL/6 lungs following LPS treatment, which was attenuated in Trpv1-/- mouse lungs

SEN:10031726	14993219	Importantly, whereas phosphorylation of Thr- 389 (RPS6KB1 P@T412) in Tsc1- and Tsc2-null MEFs was inhibited by rapamycin, phosphorylation of this site was strongly resistant to inhibition by wortmannin.
SEN:10031730	18342602	Similar to the TSC1 deficiency, Tsc2-/- cells also exhibited increased PERK phosphorylation and XBP-1 splicing as well as increased GRP78 and CHOP expression compared to WT controls (see Figures S1A and S1B available online).
SEN:10031738	20038814	The upregulation of Hes1 by mTOR was also observed in vivo, as mouse kidney tumors with hyperactive mTOR due to Tsc2 exon 3 deletion (35) exhibited enhanced Hes1 expression (Figure 2B).
SEN:10031742	20038814	Promoter reporter assays and quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed increased Hes1 promoter activity and transcript levels, indicating that the upregulation of Hes1 expression likely occurs at the transcriptional level in an mTOR-dependent manner (Figure 2C).
SEN:10031752	12849846	Morpholino-based gene knockdown of Nrf1 (anti-NRF1) produced a sequence-specific decrease in 16S rRNA insensitive to PK11195.

SEN:10031788	15271982	This is also the case in the translocation of caspase-9 or Apaf-1 to the nucleus (17, 29). Here we propose that Nucling may be a key molecule for the retention of the caspase-9/Apaf-1 complex, its translocation to the nucleus, and its activation.
SEN:10031794	15757894	We found that levels of nitric oxide measured in either plasma or isolated macrophages from Ucp2-/- mice are significantly elevated in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide challenge compared with similarly treated Ucp2+/+ mice.

This result, obtained in adult liver of USF2 ?/? mice, was consistent with the 64% reduction in the amount of L-PK protein
SEN:10031820	10620020	We found that Fam interacted with beta-catenin both in vivo and in vitro. The Fam-binding site of beta-catenin mapped to the region close to the APC or Axin-binding site of beta-catenin. Over-expression of Fam in mouse L cells resulted in an elevation of beta-catenin levels and in an elongation of the half-life of beta-catenin.
SEN:10031822	19158396	As shown in Figure 11A, the vav3 knockdown increased the attachment efficiency of TFGM AhR+/+ in the presence of EGTA to values significantly higher than those observed in untransfected wildtype cells

SEN:10031870	17208333	Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation assays using Wnt3a-conditioned medium reveals that while Wnt stimulation leads to the dissociation of beta-catenin from axin and casein kinase Ialpha (CKIalpha), Wnt treatment promotes an increase in CCND1 level and the association of beta-catenin with CCND1-CDK6.
SEN:10031876	15576404	Col1a1, osteopontin (OP; Spp1 - Mouse Genome Informatics) and OC were all significantly induced within 48 hours of Wnt3a stimulation

SEN:10031886	12538525	when Wnt5a was overexpressed in chondrocytes, cyclin D1 expression was suppressed, but p130 expression remained high (Fig. 7B,C),
SEN:10031888	12538525	This was confirmed by our observation that the expression of Pthrpr and Cbfa1 in the prehypertrophic chondrocytes was reduced and delayed and the expression of Col10a1, a hypertrophic chondrocyte marker, was absent in the Wnt5aâ/â limb from 12.5 dpc to 15.5 dpc (Fig. 2B,C).
SEN:10031890	12538525	Wnt5a was expressed in non-hypertrophic chondrocytes under the control of rat Col2a1 promoter and enhancer (Nakata et al., 1993). At 14.5 dpc, Col10a1 expression domain was either reduced (Col2a1-Wnt5a number 17) or absent (Col2a1-Wnt5a number 25).
SEN:10031892	12538525	Col2a1 expression was increased in the cartilage of the Wnt5aâ/â and Col2a1-Wnt5b mice, but decreased in the Col2a1-Wnt5a mice (Fig. 8B).

SEN:10031902	12538525	luciferase assay of the Col2a1 reporter was performed in mouse primary chondrocytes (Fig. 8C). Col2a1-luciferase activity was suppressed by Wnt5a but increased by Wnt5b in a dosedependent manner.
SEN:10031906	12538525	when Wnt5b was overexpressed, cyclin D1 expression was upregulated in all undifferentiated chondrocytes
SEN:10031910	12538525	To test whether Wnt5b plays a similar role as Wnt5a in regulating chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, Col2a1-Wnt5b transgenic mice were generated. When the long bone phenotype of Col2a1-Wnt5b was further analyzed, we found that expression of both Ihh and ColX was undetectable at 15.5 dpc (Fig. 6C)
SEN:10031916	20175907	Wrn Delta hel/Delta hel mutant mouse embryonic fibroblasts exhibit increased oxidative stress. This was reflected by increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased oxidative damage in genomic DNA, changes in ATP/ADP ratios, and a disruption of the inner mitochondrial transmembrane potential when compared to wild type mouse embryonic fibroblasts.
SEN:10031920	20965422	Mice lacking XBP1 in neurons exhibit increased levels of baseline autophagy, which leads to increased turnover of an autophagic substrate, mutant superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1), and protection against mutant SOD1-induced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Hetz et al., 2009).

SEN:10031930	18775308	JNK phosphorylation was increased in XBP1-/- small intestinal epithelia compared to controls consistent with the described TRAF2-dependent function of IRE1 to activate JNK (Urano et al., 2000) (Fig. 4B).
SEN:10031932	18342602	In contrast, upon introduction of XBP-1s, Akt phosphorylation was readily detectable in Tsc2-/- cells. There was also an increase in IRS-1 protein levels in XBP-1sexpressing cells.
SEN:10031934	19490910	Indeed, C/EBPalpha protein levels were significantly decreased in differentiating XBP1-/- MEFs while C/EBPbeta levels remained largely unaffected (Figure 4A). Similar observations were obtained in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Figure S4A).

SEN:10031986	9230307	Northern blot analysis was consistent with these results, revealing that 6â24 hr after induction, ?- and ?-globin mRNAs were induced to levels 3- to 4-fold higher in FOG- infected G1ER cells compared to control infected cells ( Figure 6C).
SEN:10032022	11741889	Notch signaling is involved in many cell fate determination events in metazoans. Ligand binding results in proteolytic cleavage to release the signal-transducing Notch intracellular domain (NICD). The nuclear protein RBP-J kappa, when complexed with NICD, acts as a transcriptional activator which, in turn, induces a target gene of Notch such as the repressors HES/E(spl) and HERP2.
SEN:10032036	10947953	In this paper, we report on a novel factor which regulates the TGF-beta response promoter.

SEN:10032210	11274184	CdCl(2), a potent inducer of HO-1, increased expression of ATF4 in mouse hepatoma cells, and detectable induction of ATF4 protein preceded that of HO-1 (30 min versus 2 h). A dominant-negative mutant of ATF4 inhibited basal and CdCl(2)-stimulated expression of a StRE-dependent/luciferase fusion construct (pE1-luc) in hepatoma cells but only basal expression in mammary epithelial MCF-7 cells
SEN:10032220	10671569	The results thus suggest that C/EBP-delta binds to the SIRE (Sterol-independent regulatory element, -17 to -1) region of the LDLR and regulates its transcription.

SEN:10032292	11278621	We demonstrate that the expression of collagenous proteins and collagen alpha2(I) (COL1A2) mRNA was inhibited following stable transfection of Fli-1 in dermal fibroblasts..... In contrast, Ets-1 stimulates COL1A2 promoter activity. In vitro binding assays demonstrate that both Fli-1 and Ets-1 form DNA-protein complexes with sequences present in COL1A2 promoter.
SEN:10032294	11278621	We demonstrate that the expression of collagenous proteins and collagen alpha2(I) (COL1A2) mRNA was inhibited following stable transfection of Fli-1 in dermal fibroblasts. We propose that Fli-1 inhibits COL1A2 promoter activity by competition with Ets-1.

Two putative cis element binding factors, STATx [21] and c-Ets-1 [22], were demonstrated in this region.
SEN:10032300	10082528	The bcl-x promoter contains potential Ets binding sites, and we show that the transcription factor, Ets2, first identified by its sequence identity to v-ets of the E26 retrovirus, can transactivate the bcl-x promoter. Transient expression of Ets2 results in the upregulation of Bcl-xL but not of Bcl-xS, an alternatively spliced gene product which induces apoptosis

EMSA studies demonstrated that recombinant p50 bound to a nonconsensus kappaB site overlapping the proximal C/EBP binding site on the CRP promoter.
SEN:10032408	10993896	Nkx3-1 facilitated SRF binding to the complex Nkx-binding site (NKE) of SMGA. Expression of mNkx3-1 in heterologous CV-1 fibroblasts was unable to elicit SMGA promoter activity but required the coexpression of serum response factor (SRF) to activate robust SMGA transcription. Thus, SMGA is a novel target for Nkx3-1, and the activity of Nkx3-1 on the SMGA promoter is dependent upon SRF.

SEN:10032494	11252722	We demonstrated that ROR alpha is expressed in human primary smooth-muscle cells and that ectopic expression of ROR alpha1 inhibits TNFalpha-induced IL-6, IL-8 and COX-2 expression in these cells.
SEN:10032500	11244511	The mRNA levels of E-cadherin were also stimulated and snail mRNA expression was inhibited upon inhibition of ILK as determined by Northern blot analysis. These data establish that ILK regulates the transcription of snail which in turn regulates the expression of E cadherin.
SEN:10032502	11278625	This hypothesis was confirmed when EAP30 was cloned and shown to interact directly with ELL in vitro and to prevent it from inhibiting transcription initiation
SEN:10032516	11124935	Supershift assays showed that the transcription factors Sp2 and Sp3 are part of the complexes formed at the Sp1-3 site, and that Sp1 does not appear to be directly involved. The data indicate that complex formation is initiated at site Sp1-3, which appears to be essential for promoter activity. However, other regions of the proximal promoter may also contribute to the regulation of MAT2A gene expression.

SEN:10032536	11086058	Using transient transfection and EMSA, we demonstrate that IL-4-activated STAT-6 binds to two different SBEs in the human CD40 promoter to inhibit STAT-1 -mediated CD40 promoter activity.
SEN:10032542	10995766	Using cotransfection experiments, we find that SPBP enhances the transcriptional activity of various transcription factors such as c-Jun, Ets1, Sp1, and Pax6. Hence, SPBP seems to act as a transcriptional coactivator.
SEN:10032550	10698518	Further characterization of this protein has identified a family of three related genes, AP-2alpha, beta and gamma (Bosher et al., 1996).

SEN:10032662	23942974	The OIR ATF4(+/-) retinas demonstrated reprogramming of the UPR seen at both the mRNA (Atf6 and Bip) and protein (pATF6 and peIf2alpha) levels, as well as a reduction in vascularization-associated gene expression (Flt1, Vegf1, Hif1, and Tgb1). These changes corresponded to the decline in the rate of neovascularization.
SEN:10032672	15788408	The ability of ATF4-/- MEF cells to increase VEGF mRNA levels following arsenite treatment was considerably less, with only a 2-fold induction.....Therefore, the screen of the putative AAREs in the sequence contexts appearing in the VEGF promoter demonstrated that only the +1767 AARE was capable of binding an ATF4-containing complex.

SEN:10032748	12896981	Mouse embryo fibroblasts nullizygous for C/EBPbeta had a proliferative advantage over cells with one or two functional copies of this gene. C/EBP inhibition enhanced the expression of the three major components of AP-1 in cycling CEF, namely c-Jun, JunD, and Fra-2, and stimulated AP-1 activity. In contrast, the over-expression of C/EBPbeta caused a dramatic reduction in the levels of AP-1 proteins.

SEN:10032984	16098831	Foxa2 occupied its binding sites in all three target genes... Therefore, the decreased activation of the PEPCK, TAT, and IGFBP-1 genes in Foxa2-deficient hepatocytes that we observed solely in the fasted state (Figure 2) indicates that Foxa2 is essential to the transcriptional response to food deprivation.
SEN:10032994	16439479	We first compared Bmp4 expression in Foxf2-/- and wild-type using a Bmp4lacZ knock in. Ã-galactosidase activity in the intestine of Foxf2-/-; Bmp4lacZ/+ embryos (E15.5) was reduced (Fig. 6B,C) in the gut, whereas tissues without Foxf expression, such as eye lids and hair follicles, retained normal Bmp4-driven Ã-galactosidase activity (Fig. 6D,E).

SEN:10033032	18368049	Examination of IL-17 expression in heterozygous RORgammatâGFP knock-in mice revealed that RORgammat+Foxp3+ lamina propria T cells produced much less IL-17 than RORgammat+Foxp3- cells, suggesting that Foxp3 may interfere with the ability of RORgammat to induce IL-17 (Fig. 1c).
SEN:10033034	18434325	As shown in Fig. 4C, transient overexpression of WT Foxp3, but not {Delta}2 or {Delta}FKH, inhibited induction of IL-17A transcription (Fig. 4C). Taken together, these observations suggest that Foxp3 interacts with ROR{gamma}t in the exon 2 region and that the FKH domain plays a critical role in the suppression of ROR{gamma}t-mediated IL-17A transcription.

SEN:10033196	15665823	Here, we demonstrate that the transcription factor IRF-5 is generally involved downstream of the TLR-MyD88 signalling pathway for gene induction of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-12 and tumour-necrosis factor-alpha. In haematopoietic cells from mice deficient in the Irf5 gene (Irf5-/- mice), the induction of these cytokines by various TLR ligands is severely impaired
SEN:10033198	14656881	Using reporter gene assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays we identified that the bcl-2 promoter activity was inhibited by ICSBP by way of a fragment containing 2 characteristic ICSBP-responsive elements.

SEN:10033222	15664998	Inhibition of the function of KLF15, either by expression of a dominant negative mutant or by RNA interference, both reduced the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) and blocked adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes exposed to inducers of adipocyte differentiation.
SEN:10033236	16244670	Conversely, KLF4 suppresses the expression of p53 by directly acting on its promoter, thereby allowing for RAS(V12)-mediated transformation and causing resistance to DNA-damage-induced apoptosis.

SEN:10033920	18250470	Antiapoptotic Bcl-xL expression was significantly decreased in isolated RelA-null colonocytes (Fig. 4E). Other NF-{kappa}B-target genes such as XIAP, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 2, Casp8 and FADD-like apoptosis regulator (CFLAR, also called cFLIP), and survivin were not affected. We also found a notable decrease of IL-11 and IL-18 expression in isolated colonocytes of IEC-RelA?/? mice.
SEN:10033922	18250470	Of note, a significant elevation in NOD2 expression was found in ceca of IEC-RelAâ/â mice, and TLR4 and TLR9 levels trended upward (p = 0.07).

SEN:10033926	15470505	(from text): Both basal expression and induction of BLC, SDF-1, ELC and SLC mRNAs were defective in IkkalphaAA/AA (nonactivatable form) stromal cells. Similar defects in expression of these chemokines have been described in RelB-/- and Nfkb2-/- mice (Poljak et al, 1999; Weih et al, 2001)...(Figure 3 - legend): IKKalpha is required for recruitment of RelB to the Blc, Sdf-1, Elc and Slc promoters.

SEN:10033962	10521394	Consistent with this finding, we report that p53 physically associates in vivo with HDACs. This interaction is not direct but, rather, is mediated by the corepressor mSin3a. Both wild-type p53 and mSin3a, but not mutant p53, can be found bound to the Map4 promoter at times when this promoter preferentially associates with deacetylated histones in vivo.
SEN:10033974	12270938	A similar BRE element is present within the BMP-responsive Nkx2-5 gene promoter (52, 55), suggesting that the Hex BRE represents a common response element for genes regulated by BMP signaling in the foregut region of the embryo.

SEN:10034024	10951586	Two Sp1 binding sites are present upstream from the CCAAT box which can bind Spl and contribute to A-myb promoter activity by 70 and 30%, respectively. The two Sp1 sites and CCAAT box together contribute to over 80% of A-myb basal promoter activity and are therefore the major regulatory elements.
SEN:10034026	10898786	A simple promoter such as that of the tyrosinase gene, comprising two E box motifs and an SP1 site, should in principle be active in all cell types, yet it is active specifically in melanocytes.

SEN:10034138	11779161	events lead to activation of Stat signaling and result in the induction of proteins, such as bcl-2 and cMyc, both of which are critical regulators of cell cycle progression and apoptosis
SEN:10034142	17277312	Moreover, STAT3 overactivation also reduced GATA3 and T-bet expression but increased the expression of RORgammat, a transcription regulator of THi differentiation (20).
SEN:10034144	20038814	Inactivation of STAT3 by either the STAT3 inhibitor AG490 (Figure 7B) or knockdown by siRNA (Figure 7C) led to reductions in p63, Jagged1, and Hes1 in all the mTOR-activated cells examined
SEN:10034152	18663125	When CD4+ T lymphocytes of STAT4-deficient mice were stimulated in the presence of IL-12 and IFN-{gamma}, no induction of twist1 expression was detectable (Fig. 2 C).

SEN:10034170	16670261	T-bet is required for the progression to the Th1 phenotype, because Tbx21-/- Th1beta cultures maintain the IL-17-secreting phenotype after 2 weeks of culture. Addition of IFN-gamma to Tbx21-/- Th1beta cultures cannot recover the progression to the Th1 phenotype, suggesting T-bet, rather than IFN-gamma, mediates Th1beta to Th1 progression.
SEN:10034176	16357323	In addition to the secretion of IFN{gamma}, overexpression of T-bet in T-betâ/â V{alpha}14i NKT cells was sufficient to induce granzyme B protein (Figure 4C) and the capacity to kill antigen-loaded CD1d+ target cells (Figure 5).
SEN:10034182	10761931	Ectopic expression of T-bet both transactivates the IFNgamma gene and induces endogenous IFNgamma production.
SEN:10034198	17195845	Our data indicate that cytokine gene expression in T(H)1 cells may be controlled by a feed-forward regulatory circuit in which T-bet induces Runx3 and then 'partners' with Runx3 to direct lineage-specific gene activation and silencing.
SEN:10034204	16357323	As was observed when T-bet was introduced into T-betâ/â V{alpha}14i NKT cells, introduction of T-bet into wild-type immature V{alpha}14i NKT cells induced the up-regulation of CCR5, CxCR3, FasL, and CD122 mRNA levels, while the expression of IFN{gamma} and granzyme B mRNA were unchanged (Figure 3D).
SEN:10034206	16357323	To assess whether TCR signaling could account for these differences, T-betâ/â V{alpha}14i NKT cells were infected as previously, sorted, placed on anti-CD3/CD28âcoated plates for 2 days, and expanded in IL-2 for several days. Under these in vitro experimental conditions, CxCR3, CCR5, CD122, and CD95L mRNA levels were up-regulated in the T-betâexpressing cells, in agreement with our previous results.
SEN:10034212	11397944	T-bet, also known as T-box 21 (Tbx21) (24), was recently described as a trans-activator specific to IFN-gâexpressing lineages that is sufficient to induce IFN-g even under TH2-polarizing conditions (5).

SEN:10034352	15531749	The increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was reduced by pretreating the cells with AG1478, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Figure 2A). Pretreatment with AG1478 decreased the levels of MUC5AC mRNAinduced by acrolein or EGF (Figures 2B and 2C).
SEN:10034354	18951912	Treatment with 2 to 10 uM acrolein led to a significant increase in ATF3 expression. This increase was detectable in cells treated with 2 uM acrolein and was maximal at 10 uM.
SEN:10034356	18951912	Treatment with 10 uM acrolein led to a 3-fold increase in ATF4 protein 4h after treatment, which was comparable to the increase in AFT4 protein in thapsigargin-treated cells (Fig. 3A).

SEN:10034386	12869663	 Bilirubin was only recently recognized as a potentially important anti-oxidant of physiological significance (Stocker et al., 1987), although this property had already been known for some time (Bernard et al., 1954). Administration of bilirubin demonstrated to be cytoprotective in models of ischemic heart injury and oxidative damage (Dore et al., 1999; Clark et al., 2000).
SEN:10034388	18633191	HO-1 is a cytoprotective enzyme (6) that degrades the potent prooxidant heme to generate CO and bilirubin. CO is a vasodilatory gas that has anti-proliferative effects on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) (7) and has anti-inflammatory properties (8). Bilirubin is a scavenger for reactive oxygen species (ROS) (9). In addition, ferrous ion, another product of HO-1, upregulates ferritin, which also has scavenger activity.

SEN:10039814	10640734	Indeed, in vitro kinase assay showed that the activity of ERK2 in Ag-stimulated K46^mA CD72 transfectants was lower than that of Ag-stimulated K46^mA (Fig. 3).
SEN:10039818	10640734	However, the CD72 transfectants showed less increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration than the parent K46^mA cells did.
SEN:10039820	10640734	Thus, expression of CD72 appears to negatively regulate BCR-mediated Ca2+ mobilization in K46^mA cells.
SEN:10039822	10640734	Taken together, CD72 down-modulates both ERK activation and Ca2+ mobilization induced by BCR ligation, strongly suggesting that CD72 negatively regulates BCR signaling in K46^mA cells.
SEN:10039824	10640734	Western blotting of total cell lysates using anti-phospho-ERK Ab showed that both ERK1 and ERK2 were phosphorylated by either BCR ligation alone or coligation of BCR and CD72 (Fig. 6B).
SEN:10039826	10640734	However, BCR ligation induced stronger ERK phosphorylation than coligation of CD72 with BCR did, indicating that BCR ligation-induced phosphorylation of ERK is down-modulated when CD72 is coligated with BCR.
SEN:10039828	10640734	Phosphorylation of both ERK1 and ERK2 induced by coligation of BCR and CD72 was weaker than that induced by BCR ligation alone (Fig. 6 C), indicating that coligation with CD72 reduced BCR ligation-mediated phosphorylation of ERK in DBA/2 spleen cells.
SEN:10039830	10640734	Coligation of CD72 with BCR showed a reduced Ca2+ flux compared to that with BCR ligation alone in spleen B cells (Fig. 6D).
SEN:10039832	10640734	Taken together, these results indicate that coligation with CD72 negatively regulates BCR-induced ERK activation and Ca2+ concentration in normal spleen B cells.
SEN:10039834	16885377	Sorted WT B cells produced more IL-10 than CD40 knockout (CD40KO) B cells when cocultured with EL-4 gag or D5 (but not MCA304).
SEN:10039842	16885377	Most IFN-g-producing cells from BKO spleen cells at day 3 or 4 were NK-1.1 positive (Fig. 1B).
SEN:10039844	16885377	These results indicate that substantially enhanced IFN-g responses by CD8 T cells and NK cells are induced by EL-4 gag cells or D5 tumor cells but not MCA304 sarcoma cells (Fig. 1D).
SEN:10039856	16885377	CD40L was expressed on tumor cells that induced IL-10 from B cells (Fig. 4A) but not on MCA304 cells.
SEN:10039858	16885377	IL-10 production was significantly attenuated when tumor cells were cultured with CD40KO B cells compared with WT B cells, whereas differences in IL-10 levels were also observed between IL-10KO and CD40KO B cells (Fig. 4B).
SEN:10039860	16885377	These results indicate that B-cell IL-10 production is partially dependent on CD40-CD40L interactions.
SEN:10039862	16885377	Furthermore, IL-10 production by B cells was attenuated by anti-CD40L blocking antibody (Fig. 4C).
SEN:10039864	16885377	IFN-g production was diminished in BKO spleen cells by rIL-10 (Fig. 4D).
SEN:10039866	16885377	These results indicate that B cells may reduce IFN-g production by producing IL-10.
SEN:10039868	16885377	These results suggest that (a) IL-10 produced from B cells lowers IFN-g production and (b) this effect is partially CD40-CD40L dependent.
SEN:10039870	16885377	After washing, these âCD40-stimulating antibody-expressing'' MCA304 cells induced IFN-g from NK (Fig. 4G) and CD8 T cells (Fig. 4H), indicating that CD40-CD40L interactions can trigger IFN-g production.
SEN:10039876	19366834	The transition from normal to neoplastic glands in prostate cancer (PCa) is marked by a dramatic decline of IL-7 and BAFF/ BLyS production.
SEN:10039878	19366834	B-cell andT-cell expression of bcl-2 decrease, whereas the apoptotic events increase.
SEN:10039884	19366834	Prostate-infiltrating lymphocytes display low proliferation but wide expression of the antiapoptotic protein bcl-2.
SEN:10039886	19366834	The vast majority of prostatic lymphocytes, both stromal (organized in LFs, that is, CD20+ B-cell follicle encircled by parafollicular T-cell area, Fig. 4C-H, or not organized, Fig. 4I-K) and intraepithelial lymphocytes (Fig. 4L), strongly expressed the antiapoptotic protein bcl-2.
SEN:10039888	19366834	Loss of IL-7 and BAFF production in neoplastic prostatic glands is accompanied by reduction of CD8+ and CD20+ cell infiltrates.
SEN:10039890	19366834	Real-time RT-PCR revealed that, in contrast to normal prostatic glands, malignant glands showed low to absent, ~ 60 times lower than in the normal glands (Fig. 5A), IL-7 mRNA expression.
SEN:10039892	19366834	Expression of the chemokines B lymphocyte chemo-attractant, also called CXCL13, and secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine, also known as CCL21, which we previously found (2) associated with LFs, was lost too (Fig. 5B, c-e).
SEN:10039894	19366834	At the same time, the percentage of CD8+ cells with positive cytoplasmic staining for the antiapoptotic protein bcl-2 was decreased in PCa (85.1 + 5.3%; Fig. 5D, a and b), in comparison with the normal prostate (97.0 + 2.4%), as assessed by double CD8/bcl-2 staining on paraffin sections.
SEN:10039898	19366834	LCM followed by real-time RT-PCR examination of neoplastic glands versus normal glands revealed a low to absent, about five times lower than in the normal glands, BAFF mRNA expression (Fig. 5E).
SEN:10039934	21278302	In contrast, the adoptive transfer of CpG-activated B cells induced tumor arrest, associated with a reduced suppressive immune environment due to the lower recruitment of regulatory T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and CD81 regulatory T cells along with the reduced expression of suppressive cytokines such as IL-10 and transforming growth factor-(b.
SEN:10039952	21278302	Moreover, the expression of DR5, one of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors, was also increased in the lungs of mice transferred with CpG-pulsed B cells (Figure E4A).
SEN:10039954	21278302	Similarly, we observed a higher release of IL-18 (Figure E4B) and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling)-positive cells (data not shown) in the lungs of tumor-bearing mice adoptively transferred with CpG-pulsed B cells than in the other group of animals.
SEN:10039956	21278302	CpG treatment of B cells increased the levels of IFN-b (Figure 3B), lymphotoxin-b (LTb) (Figure 3C), IL-1b (Figure 3D), and IL-12p40 (Figure 3E) but reduced those of TNF-a (Figure 3F) and IL-10 (Figure 3G).
SEN:10040020	23365136	In contrast, only TLR7-9 ligands (single-stranded RNA and unmethylated CpG-ODN) reversed the phenotype (upregu-lated CD20 and downregulated CD25+CD81High; Fig. 4A; Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B) and blocked the regulatory activity of murine and human tBregs (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S3A-S3C).
SEN:10040024	23365136	Instead, B cells from these mice activated T-cell responses, as they induced proliferation of T cells (Fig. 5C and Supplementary Fig. S4A) and expanded GrzB-expressing CD8+ T cells (Supplementary Fig. S4B and S4C) that readily and significantly lysed 4T1.2 cancer cells (Fig. 5D).
SEN:10040028	23365136	However, we found that, compared with B-LPS or even with normal B cells, expression of 4-1BBL, an immunostimulatory receptor that activates CD8+ T cells and NK cells via4-1BB (37,38), was significantly reduced on murine and human tBregs (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. S6A and S6B).
SEN:10040030	23365136	However, BLC-arp/CpG treatment reversed the reduced expression of 4-1BBL on murine and human tBregs (Fig. 6C) as well as in vivo in tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 6D).
SEN:10040102	24043896	RSV inhibits tBreg-mediated Treg conversion by blocking TGF-b1.
SEN:10040104	24043896	Unlike control B cells from naive BALB/c mice, which did not induce Foxp3 in non-Tregs, regardless of the presence or absence of the inhibitor (Fig. 6A), tBregs or tumor B cells only converted Foxp3+ Tregs in the absence of SB431542 (Fig. 6A).
SEN:10040108	24043896	Similarly, in vivo, B cells from tumor-bearing mice treated with 50 mg RSV also failed to secrete significant amounts of TGF-P1 (RSV, Fig. 6D), whereas B cells from mock-treated mice with 4T1.2 cancer produced abundant TGF-b (p < 0.01, Mock versus RSV, Fig. 6D).
SEN:10040112	24043896	Importantly, like RSV, Stat3 inhibitors also inhibited TGF-P1 expression in tBregs (Fig. 7C), a key factor required for tBreg-mediated conversion of Foxp3+ Tregs from non-Treg cells (13).
SEN:10040170	16365420	Nor-NOHA treatment partially reversed suppression by both 4T1 and 4T1/IL-10 MSC, whereas l-NMMA treatment had no effect.
SEN:10040180	16365420	Therefore, 4T1/IL-1fi MSC express more ROS on a per cell basis than 4T1 MSC, and a significant amount of this ROS production is affected by arginase production.
SEN:10040208	17483367	To determine if 4T1-induced MDSC from EP2_/~ mice inhibit by the same mechanism, nor-NOHA, an inhibitor of arginase, was added to some of the D011.10 and clone 4 transgenic T-cell cultures of Fig. 4. Nor-NOHA reverses the suppression CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by both BALB/c and EP2_/~ MDSC, although it is more effective in reducing suppression of CD4+ T cells than of CD8+ T cells.
SEN:10040216	17942936	Results Tumor-associated inflammation is reduced in IL-1Râ/â mice.
SEN:10040218	17942936	Canonical proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, MCP-1, TGFh, and IL-1h were significantly elevated in 4T1 tumor tissue.
SEN:10040222	17942936	Additionally, IL-1Râ/â tumor tissue had less IL-12p70 and more TGFh and IFNg than tumor tissue from wild-type BALB/c mice.
SEN:10040248	17942936	A potential downstream candidate is the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-6, the production of which is reduced in IL-1Râ/â tumor tissue (Fig. 1B).
SEN:10040272	18753637	In the presence of IL-12, NK cells produced larger amounts of IFN-g.
SEN:10040278	18753637	Addition of Fab fragments of anti-NKG2D mAb to the cocultures significantly reduced the secretion of IFN-7, whereas Fab fragments of the isotype-matched control mAb had no effect (Figure 5D).
SEN:10040294	18802069	However, NF-kB was phosphorylated in MDSC from both tumor-bearing and tumor-free mice within the first 10 min of incubation at a level comparable to activation by TNF-a, a NF-KB-dependent gene that is known to be activated by S100A8/A9 (22) (Fig. 3E).
SEN:10040296	18802069	We found that 4T1 cells secrete S100A8/A9 proteins (Fig. 3F) and 4T1 supernatants are chemoattractants for MDSC (Fig. 3G).
SEN:10040302	18809714	TCM prevented the down-regulation of S100A9 mRNA expression during differentiation in vitro (Fig. 1 A).
SEN:10040308	18809714	Gr-1+ cells isolated after a 5-d culture of HPCs with GM-CSF and IL-4 in TCM expressed substantially more S100A8 and S100A9 proteins than did Gr-1_ cells (Fig. 1 C).
SEN:10040336	18809714	Expression of the constitutively active STAT3 mutant STAT3C in ES cells maintained a high level of S100A9 expression after LIF withdrawal (Fig. 6, B and C).
SEN:10040338	18809714	STAT3 depletion resulted in the down-regulation of S100A8 and S100A9 gene expression (Fig. 6 E), as well as the levels of both proteins (Fig. 6 F).
SEN:10040340	18809714	Collectively, these data demonstrate that STAT3 up-regulates the expression of S100A8 and S100A9 both in vitro and in vivo.
SEN:10040342	18809714	Consistent with this hypothesis, amounts of ROS in the spleen and bone marrow were four- to fivefold greater in Gr-1+GFP+ cells from S100A9Tg mice than in Gr-1+GFPâ cells from wild-type and S100A9T mice (Fig. 7 A).
SEN:10040344	18809714	However, ROS levels in MDSCs from tumor-bearing S100A9KO mice were substantially lower than in tumor-bearing wild-type mice and were equivalent to ROS levels in naive wild-type mice (Fig. 7 B).
SEN:10040420	20605485	Both IL-6 and G-CSF treatment did not markedly change surface IL-4Ra amounts on BM cells; moreover, IL-6 had a detrimental effect on cell viability, thereby preventing any further functional characterization.
SEN:10040422	20605485	Despite the increased IL-4Ra expression following G-CSF treatment, this cytokine did not induce any appreciable imunosuppressive function in BM cells.
SEN:10040424	20605485	GM-CSF induced a significant increase (p = 0.028 versus untreated BM) of IL-4Ra expression, and BM cells cultured with this cytokine inhibited CTL activity in a dose-dependent fashion (Figures 1A and 1B).
SEN:10040432	20605485	When we analyzed the percentage of the different subsets of CD11b+Gr-1+ cells, percentages of CD11bhiGr-1hi and CD11bhiGr-1- cells were decreased in both C/EBPp-deficient strains, but subsets characterized by low and intermediate expression of the Gr-1 marker were significantly decreased only in fully ablated mice (Figure 3D).
SEN:10040442	20605485	Following separation of CD11b+ cells from MCA203 tumor infiltrate, we found that loss of C/EBPp caused a significant reduction in both arginase 1 (Arg1) and nitric oxide synthase 2 (Nos2) proteins (Figure 6A), two enzymes that were described as crucial components of MDSC inhibitory machinery (Bronte and Zanovello, 2005; Gabrilovich and Nagaraj, 2009).
SEN:10040446	20605485	Cytokines were able to upregulate IL-4Ra expression, but a more pronounced effect was obtained by G-CSF+GM-CSF combination (Figure 7B and Figure S6B).
SEN:10040466	20876310	Inhibition of iNOS with LMMA and of arginase I with nor-NOH completely abrogated suppressive activity of tumor-derived MDSC (Fig. 2 F).
SEN:10040468	20876310	Thus, MDSCs from the tumor use primarily arginase and NO to suppress T cell role, whereas splenic MDSCs use primarily ROS.
SEN:10040480	20876310	In contrast, hypoxia dramatically up-regulated expression of argl and inos (Fig. 5 C).
SEN:10040488	20876310	DFO caused significant up-regulation of the expression of argl and inos and a decrease in the expression of NOX components p47phox andgp91phox (Fig. 6, D and E).
SEN:10040490	20876310	Expression of argl and inos in HIF-1a-positive MDSC was dramatically up-regulated after transfer into the tumor site (Fig. 6 I).
SEN:10040494	20876310	HIF-1a-deficient MDSCs had substantially higher ROS production than their WT counterparts (Fig. 6 K).
SEN:10040496	20876310	Half of HIF-1a WT Gr-1- donor cells acquired the F4/80 marker of M$ and 20% became CD11c+ DCs (Fig. 7 A).
SEN:10040498	20876310	In contrast, HIF-1a-deficient MDSC acquired CD11c marker, with only 20% of cells expressing F4/80 (Fig. 7 A).
SEN:10040502	20876310	Hypoxia caused a dramatic up-regulation of arg1 and inos in HIF-1a WT MDSC, whereas a much smaller effect was observed in HIF-1a-deficient MDSC (Fig. 7 B).
SEN:10040508	21110318	Interestingly, in 4T1/IL-1p-tumor bearing mice the ratio of Lyc6low to Ly6Cneg MDSC was reversed, that is, this newly identified subpopulation of Ly6Cneg MDSC represented 75-90% of polymophonuclear (PMN)-MDSC in those mice (Figure 1C, D and Supplemental Figure 2A).
SEN:10040522	21110318	Using these markers we found a similar percentage of CD27+ NK cells in the bone marrow of all mice (Figure 4B), however, NK cells from 4T1/IL-1p-tumor bearing mice expressed 5-10-times less CD27 protein than NK cells from the other mice (Figure 4B).
SEN:10040524	21110318	Ly6Cneg MDSC affect NKG2D expression by NK cells in vitro and in vivo. Further analyses showed a rapid down-modulation of NKG2D but not NKp46 expression by NK cells after injection of 4T1- and 4T1/IL-1p-tumor cells.
SEN:10040526	21110318	The reduced expression of NKG2D occurred earlier and was more pronounced in 4T1/IL-ip-than in 4T1-tumor mice (Figure 5A and data not shown).
SEN:10040546	21213211	As shown in Figure 1c, with the differentiation of CD11b+Gr1+ cells from BMCs upon exposure to CT26 tumor, 1D8 tumor and tumor-associated factor PGE2, the expression of both pri-miR-223 and mature miR-223 was downregulated although there had a temporary up-regulation.
SEN:10040556	21213211	In contrast to miR-223 expression, CD11b+Gr1+ cells and both CD11b+Ly6G~Ly6C+ and CD11b+Ly6C+Ly6G+ subsets isolated from the spleens of mice bearing tumors had higher levels of expression of MEF2C than those from the spleens of disease-free mice (Fig. 3a).
SEN:10040558	21213211	Similarly, the expression of MEF2C was upregulated in the tumor-induced MDSCs (Fig. 3b) although there had a temporary downregulation.
SEN:10040574	21213211	Meanwhile, miR-223-engineered cells had reduced MEF2C expression when compared to controls (Supporting Information Fig. S7).
SEN:10040580	21378275	In the lung, the concentration of IL-6 was increased, which aberrantly activated oncogenic Stat3 and increased expression of Stat3 downstream genes in epithelial tumor progenitor cells.
SEN:10040582	21378275	Spontaneous emphysema and lung adenocarcinoma were sequentially developed after MMP12 overexpression.
SEN:10040590	21378275	MMP12 suppresses T-cell proliferation and function in vivo The CD4+ T-lymphocyte population was significantly decreased in the spleen of doxycycline-treated bitransgenic mice (5.58%) compared with that in untreated ones (21.14%), while the CD8+ T-lymphocyte population was less affected (Figure 2A).
SEN:10040594	21378275	The culture medium showed decreased secretion of IL-2, IL-4, and IFN7 in the activated MMP12-treated samples (Figure 2F).
SEN:10040598	21378275	CD11b+/Gr-1+ cells from doxcycline-treated bitransgenic mice showed the strongest inhibition on proliferation of wild-type CD4+ T cells (Figure 3C).
SEN:10040600	21378275	This inhibition was further confirmed by a significant reduction of IL-2 and IL-4 secretion, implicating a functional impairment of CD4+ T cells by CD11b+/Gr-1+ cells from doxcycline-treated bitransgenic mice (Figure 3D).
SEN:10040608	21378275	Compared with doxycycline-untreated bitransgenic mice, the expression levels of IL-1p, IL-6, MIP-2, and TNF-a were abnormally increased in the plasma of doxycycline-treated bitransgenic mice (Figure 4A).
SEN:10040636	21383238	The expression of miR-17-5p and miR-20a in tumor-associated MDSCs was found to be lower than in Gr1+CD11b+ cells isolated from the spleens of disease-free mice.
SEN:10040638	21383238	Tumor-associated factor downregulates the expression of both miR-17-5p and miR-20a.
SEN:10040640	21383238	STAT3 is regulated by miR-17-5p and miR-20a.
SEN:10040642	21383238	We found that miR17-5p or miR-20a affects STAT3 expression only at the protein level.
SEN:10040644	21383238	As shown in Fig. 2, the levels of STAT3 protein in RAW 264.7 cells transfected with miR17-5p or miR-20a mimics were indeed lower than in negative control transfected cells, whereas the transcription level of STAT3 was not affected.
SEN:10040646	21383238	As shown in Fig. 2, miR-17-5p and miR-20a also reduced the transcriptional and protein levels of p47phox and gp91 phox, two subunits of NADPH oxidase.
SEN:10040648	21383238	Thus, our results demonstrate that both miR-17-5p and miR-20a target the STAT3 3'UTR to reduce the expression of STAT3.
SEN:10040652	21383238	As a positive control, STAT3-targeted siRNAs also inhibit the expression of ROS and the production of H2O2 (Supplemental Fig. 3).
SEN:10040654	21383238	As shown in Fig. 3A and 3B, the transfection of miR-17-5p and miR-20a mimics reduces the expression of ROS and the production of H2O2 in the isolated tumor-associated MDSCs in the presence of PMA.
SEN:10040668	21383238	As shown in Fig. 5A, Gr1+CD11b+ cells isolated from the spleens of CT-26 tumor-bearing mice have lower levels of expression of both pri- and mature miR-17-5p and miR-20a than do Gr1+CD11b+ cells from the spleens of disease-free mice (p < 0.05).
SEN:10040670	21383238	As shown in Fig. 5B, tumor-associated factors can upregulate the expression of miR-17-5p and miR-20a, but the expression of miR-17-5p and miR-20a is downregulated after 6 h exposure to tumor supernatants.
SEN:10040672	21383238	Conversely, the expression of STAT3 was found to be upregulated after a temporary downregulation.
SEN:10040678	21383238	The role of miR-17-5p and miR-20a in the expression of ROS and production of H2O2 by CD11b+Ly6G+ can be blocked by miR-17-5p or miR-20a inhibitors.
SEN:10040682	21450901	Although control antibody-treated MDSCs from tumor-free and tumor-bearing mice had some background-cleaved caspase3 expression, Jo2 mAb-treated cells from both tumor-bearing and tumor-free mice had significantly higher levels of cleaved caspase3.
SEN:10040684	21450901	Jo2-treated MDSCs also contained activated caspase3 as detected by Western blot analysis (Figure 3B).
SEN:10040686	21450901	Ninety-two percent of Gr1+CD11b+ MDSCs treated with Jo2 mAb were strongly positive for cleaved caspase3, whereas only 5% of control mAb-treated cells were strongly positive.
SEN:10040706	21670304	These data indicate that during DMBA/TPA-induced squamous carcinogenesis TNF-a mediates tumor-promoting activity via regulatory B cells that repress antitumor immunity.
SEN:10040716	21670304	There were no other significant differences in leukocyte infiltrate.. CCL5, a T-cell chemoattractant, was increased threefold in untreated Tnf-/- epidermis compared with wild-type epidermis (Fig. 2C, Left) and also increased in DMBA/TPA-treated Tnf-/-epidermis compared with wild-type (Fig. 2C, Center).
SEN:10040718	21670304	IFN-y mRNA was 10-fold higher in untreated Tnf-/- epidermis than in untreated wild-type epidermis (Fig. 2D, Left) and was higher at all time points during DMBA/TPA treatment (Fig. 2D, Center).
SEN:10040720	21670304	CCL5 mRNA was lower in Tnf-/- epidermis after transfer of wild-type B cells, as was IFN-y mRNA at 10 wk (Fig. 2 C and D, Right).
SEN:10040724	21670304	LPS-stimulated CD19+ B cells isolated from Tnf mice produced less IL-10 and more total IL-12 (IL-12p70) than did CD19+ B cells from wild-type mice (Fig. 3C; P < 0.05).
SEN:10040730	21670304	We found that Tnf mice are deficient for CD19+CD21high B cells compared with wild-type mice, both in terms of percentage of cells and absolute number (Fig. 4C; P < 0.01, Fig. S2B).
SEN:10040732	21670304	DMBA/TPA-treated Tnf mice had more IFN-y+ T cells in spleens (P < 0.05) than wild-type treated mice (Fig. 4D).
SEN:10040800	21972293	This effect was abrogated by the addition of COX2 inhibitor during the generation of CM from cancer ascites cells.
SEN:10040810	21972293	Whereas the MDSCs isolated from cancer patients expressed COX2 and secreted high levels of PGE2 (Figure 4B) compared with control CD11b+ cells from normal blood, their PGE2 secretion was blocked by celecoxib treatment (Figure 4B).
SEN:10040908	22132131	Factors from murine pancreatic cancer cells cause the down-regulation of SHIP-1 expression, which may potentially contribute to MDSC expansion, and the suppression of CD8+ T cell immune responses.
SEN:10040910	22132131	qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses revealed the in vivo down-regulation of SHIP-1 expression in splenocytes from TB mice.
SEN:10040912	22132131	Western blot analyses also detected reduced SHIP-1 activity, increased AKT-1 and BAD hyper-phosphorylation and up-regulation of BCL-2 expression in splenocytes from TB mice.
SEN:10040914	22132131	In vitro, qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses detected reduced SHIP-1 mRNA and protein expression in control splenocytes co-cultured with Panc 02.03 cells.
SEN:10040918	22132131	Results from the Inflammatory Cytometric Bead Analysis (CBA) Kit detected pro-inflammatory factors Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-10 (IL-10) and Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1) to a greater extent than Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF), Interferon gamma (IFN-y and Interleukin-12p 70 (IL-12p70) in the supernatants of cultured murine Panc 02.03 cells (Figure 1a).
SEN:10040920	22132131	TB splenocytes have a reduction in SHIP-1 expression.
SEN:10040922	22132131	Quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) results detected a decrease in SHIP-1 mRNA expression in TB compared to control splenocytes (Figure 3b).
SEN:10040924	22132131	TB splenocytes have reduced SHIP-1 activity.
SEN:10040926	22132131	Western blot analyses did not detect phosphorylation of tyrosine 1020 on SHIP-1, in splenocytes from TB compared to control mice (Figure 4a).
SEN:10040928	22132131	TB splenocytes have increased AKT activity.
SEN:10040930	22132131	Western Blot results revealed hyper-phosphorylation of AKT-1 at Ser473 in whole splenocytes from TB compared to control mice (Figure 4b).
SEN:10040932	22132131	TB splenocytes have increased BCL-2 expression.
SEN:10040934	22132131	Western Blot results showed hyperphosphorylation of BAD at Ser112 in splenocytes from TB mice compared to control mice (Figure 4c).
SEN:10040936	22132131	Western blot results revealed an up-regulation in BCL-2 expression in splenocytes from TB mice (Figure 4d) compared to control.
SEN:10040938	22132131	Murine Panc 02.03 cells down-regulate SHIP-1 expression in vitro.
SEN:10040940	22132131	qRT-PCR analysis revealed a significant decrease in SHIP-1 mRNA expression in control splenocytes co-cultured with Panc 02.03 cells compared to control splenocytes cultured alone (Figure 5a).
SEN:10040942	22132131	In addition, western blot results revealed greater than a a 2-fold reduction in SHIP-1 protein expression in control splenocytes cocultured with Panc 02.03 cells compared to control splenocytes cultured alone (Figure 5b).
SEN:10040944	22132131	These results correlate with our in vivo data and show that Panc 02.03 cells are able to suppress SHIP-1 mRNA and protein expression in vitro.
SEN:10040962	22529296	L-NIL downregulates STAT3 activation and inhibits ROS production in MDSC.
SEN:10040964	22529296	However, ROS levels were dramatically upregulated in Transwell culture with MT-RET-1 cells (Fig. 2A, 2B), and upregulation of ROS was suppressed to levels below baseline by addition of L-NIL to coculture.
SEN:10040966	22529296	Coculture with MT-RET-1 cells also strongly upregulated levels of activated phospho-STAT3 in bone marrow-derived MDSC, and STAT3 activation was suppressed by addition of L-NIL (Fig. 2C).
SEN:10040968	22529296	Release of VEGF from tumor cells has also been shown to be upregulated by iNOS expression.
SEN:10040970	22529296	VEGF release by MT-RET-1 cells was reduced >2-fold by L-NIL in vitro (Fig. 3A) without evidence of direct toxicity to tumor cells (Supplemental Fig. 1B)..
SEN:10040980	22529296	ROS levels in MDSC from spleen of L-NIL-treated tumor-bearing mice were significantly reduced as compared with untreated mice (Fig. 6C).
SEN:10040982	22529296	Western blot analysis of total and phospho-STAT3 levels in MT-RET-1 tumors demonstrated robust phosphorylation of serine 727 and tyrosine 705 in tumors from untreated mice.
SEN:10040984	22529296	Treatment of both 4-d (data not shown) and 14-d MT-RET-1 tumors with L-NIL increased numbers of tumor-infiltrating and splenic CD4 and CD8 T cells in wild-type mice (Fig. 4B).
SEN:10040986	22529296	Whereas splenic T cell levels were reduced in the tumor-bearing state, L-NIL treatment restored numbers of splenic CD4 and CD8 T cells to numbers comparable to those seen in tumor-free mice (3 X 106 CD4 and 2.5 X 106 CD8 T cells) and reversed the splenomegaly observed in many tumor-bearing mice (data not shown).
SEN:10040990	22529296	L-NIL treatment of iNOS-deficient mice led to robust recovery of splenic CD4 and CD8 T cell numbers (Fig. 4B), demonstrating that the failure of host iNOS ablation to restore T cell numbers in tumor-bearing mice is not due to upregulation of iNOS-independent compensatory mechanisms in iNOS KO mice.
SEN:10040994	22544933	In this study, we identified microRNA-494 (miR-494), whose expression was dramatically induced by tumor-derived factors, as an essential player in regulating the accumulation and activity of MDSCs by targeting of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and activation of the Akt pathway.
SEN:10041002	22544933	miR-494 is highly expressed in tumor-expanded MDSCs.
SEN:10041006	22544933	As shown in Fig. 1C, significantly increased expression of miR-494 was detected in both subpopulations compared with their counterpart from tumor-free mice (granulocytic MDSCs, p < 0.01; monocytic MDSCs, p < 0.001).
SEN:10041010	22544933	Tumor-derived factors, especially TG'F-fH, markedly induce the upregulation of miR-494 in MDSCs.
SEN:10041012	22544933	As expected, we found that miR-494 expression was significantly induced by TCCM in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A).
SEN:10041014	22544933	As shown in Fig. 2B, we found that the expression of miR-494 in Gr-1+ CD11b+ cells was not affected by GM-CSF and IL-6, but interestingly, miR-494 expression was significantly induced by TGF-b1 treatment (p < 0.001).
SEN:10041016	22544933	Moreover, the induction of miR-494 was partially blocked by anti-TGF-p1 mAb in cells stimulated with 4T1 TCCM (Fig. 2C), and the upregulation of miR-494 was impaired in Smad 3-deficient Gr-1+ CD11b+ cells isolated from the spleen of Smad 3_/_ mice (Fig. 2D).
SEN:10041022	22544933	As expected, the expression levels of ARG1, MMP2, MMP13, and MMP14 were significantly upregulated in lv-494-infected MDSCs compared with those in lv-ctrl-infected MDSCs (Fig. 4B); moreover, lv-sponge overtly blocked the induction in the expression of these molecules.
SEN:10041028	22544933	As shown in Fig. 4G, OT-1 CD8+ T cell proliferation was significantly suppressed by lv-494-infected MDSCs in comparison with lv-ctrl-infected MDSCs, and this suppressive activity could be partially blocked by an ARG1 inhibitor nor-NOHA.
SEN:10041038	22544933	Notably, the PTEN protein level was significantly downregulated in tumor-expanded MDSCs compared with that in Gr-1+ CD11b+ cells from tumor-free mice, whereas PTEN mRNA expression showed no difference (Fig. 6A).
SEN:10041040	22544933	When the reporter plasmids with miR-494 mimics or the scrambled oligonucleotide were cotransfected to HEK-293 cells, we observed that the miR-494 mimics markedly decreased the luciferase activity (Fig. 6B).
SEN:10041042	22544933	Furthermore, transfection of lv-494 significantly decreased PTEN expression in MDSCs, thus suggesting that endogenous PTEN is targeted and regulated by miR-494 (Fig. 6C).. To confirm whether miR-494-induced activation of MDSCs was mediated by targeting of PTEN expression, we designed a lentiviral vector encoding 39-UTR-depleted PTEN to enforce the expression of PTEN in MDSCs.
SEN:10041044	22544933	Overexpression of PTEN in Gr-1+ CD11b+ cells did not affect the TDF-induced miR-494 up-regulation, whereas the increased expression of MMPs induced by TCCM were significantly blocked (Fig. 6D), and SDF-1/CXCL12-mediated MDSC migration was abrogated (Fig. 6E).
SEN:10041046	22544933	Significantly reduced PTEN expression was also detected in Gr-1+ CD11b+ cells after TCCM stimulation (Fig. 6G); this was inversely correlated with the phosphorylation levels of mTOR and NF-kB.
SEN:10041048	22544933	As shown in Fig. 6H, the increased levels of MMPs induced by TCCM were completely abolished by LY294002, suggesting that the Akt activity is indispensable for the activation of MDSCs.
SEN:10041050	22544933	BAY-117802 significantly blocked MMP13 expression but had a limited effect on the upregulation of MMP2 and MMP14, whereas rapamycin eliminated the expression of all MMPs.
SEN:10041052	22544933	TGF-p1-induced miR-494 was involved in the negative regulation of PTEN expression.
SEN:10041062	23878002	Upon coculture with OVA-stimulated TCR transgenic OT-1 splenocytes, WT MO-MDSCs suppressed T-cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, while IFN-yR-/- and STAT-1-/-MO-MDSCs almost completely lost their suppressive capacity (Fig. 1A and Supporting Information Fig. 2A for CFSE dilution).
SEN:10041064	23878002	Interestingly, when treating MO-MDSCs with recombinant IFN-y, only 72% of the population phosphorylates STAT-1, illustrating MO-MDSC heterogeneity and suggesting that only the IFN-y-responsive part of this population mediates suppression (Supporting Information Fig. 3).
SEN:10041068	23878002	The relatively minor importance of IFN-y is not due to a lack of IFN-y responsiveness, since IFN-y treatment of PMN-MDSCs uniformly phosphorylates STAT-1 (Supporting Information Fig. 3).
SEN:10041096	23878002	Conversely, SNAP increased Fas expression, although never to the levels seen with MO-MDSCs, suggesting that NO is crucial but not sufficient to maximize Fas expression on CD8+ T cells.
SEN:10041118	24127488	We found that both PLC72_/~ PMN- and MO-MDSCs had greater immune-suppressive effects on CD8+ T cell proliferation than WT MDSCs in both antigen- and mitogen-driven T cell stimulatory conditions (Fig. 5, A and B).
SEN:10041120	24127488	WT PMN-MDSCs predominantly produced ROS, whereas WT MO-MDSCs mainly released nitrites (Fig. 5, C and D).
SEN:10041122	24127488	In contrast, PMN-MDSCs and MO-MDSCs from PLC72~7~ mice released both high levels of ROS and NO (Fig. 5, C and D).
SEN:10041124	24127488	Results show increased p-catenin protein levels in PLC^2-deficient MDSCs treated with PDBu compared with untreated cells (Fig. 6 B), indicating that PLC^2 can regulate p-catenin levels via DAG-dependent PKC activation.
SEN:10041136	24127488	Consistent with this observation, the percentage of CD8+ T cells infiltrating the tumor was significantly increased in PLC^2cKO/p-cat.CA compared with PLC^2cKO (Fig. 7 E).
SEN:10041138	24127488	As expected from our previous result (Fig. 5 B), CD8+ T cell proliferation is strongly diminished by PLC^2cKO MDSCs compared with control.
SEN:10041144	24220241	Expression of Notch target genes hesl and hes5 was dramatically reduced in all 3 populations of cells isolated from TB mice as compared with the cells from naive mice (Fig. 1A and B).
SEN:10041146	24220241	The CSL/ CBF1-specific binding in HPCs from TB mice was substantially lower than the binding in HPCs from control mice (Fig. 1D).
SEN:10041148	24220241	Three-day culture of human CD34+ HPC with TCM from breast carcinoma MCF7 and small cell lung cancer cell line 81M1 caused significant (P < 0.01) decrease in the expression of HES1 (Fig. 1H).
SEN:10041152	24220241	Significant reduction in the expression of hes1 was observed, whereas no differences were seen in the expression of notch1 and notch2 (Fig. 2D).
SEN:10041154	24220241	Dramatic downregulation of all studied Notch ligands (Jag1, Jag2, Dll1, 3, and 4) was found in bone marrow from CT26 TB mice as compared with naive tumor-free mice (Fig. 2E).
SEN:10041156	24220241	In the absence of TCM, Dll1 caused 6-fold increase in hes1 expression.
SEN:10041160	24220241	Culture of HPC with TCM resulted in an increase in serine phosphorylation of Notch1 (Fig. 4A), whereas no tyrosine phosphorylation was detected (data not shown).. Analysis of the structure of Notch suggested a number of serine residues in RAM domain, phosphorylation of which could affect binding of Notch1 with CSL.
SEN:10041162	24220241	However, after mutations in S1901 and T1898, Notch1 construct lost binding to CSL in MDSC (Fig. 4C) and was associated with substantially reduced level of serine phosphorylation in the presence of TCM (Fig. 4C).
SEN:10041164	24220241	We observed that MDSC transfected with control siRNA cultured with TCM had significantly (P < 0.01) lower hes1 expression than cells cultured in complete medium.
SEN:10041166	24220241	Inhibition of CK2 abrogated serine phosphoryla- tion of ICN caused by TCM and restored interaction between ICN and CSL (Fig. 6B).. .
SEN:10041170	24220241	This was associated with significant increase in the expression of hes1 in these cells (Fig. 7C).
SEN:10041198	24259296	Conversely, PTIO prevented the T cell suppression effect induced by Mo-MDSC in both tumor models, without having an effect in G-MDSC suppression (Fig. 3b).
SEN:10041200	24259296	A significant prevention in the production of PNT by G-MDSC, but not by Mo-MDSC, was found in tumor-bearing gp91phox and eNOS null mice, as compared to MDSC from control mice (Fig. 4a).
SEN:10041202	24259296	4b and 4c), suggesting the fundamental role of eNOS and gp91phox in the PNT-linked suppression induced by G-MDSC.
SEN:10041210	24391219	High levels of miR-155 and miR-21 also were detected in bone marrow and spleen MDSC isolated from tumor-bearing mice.
SEN:10041212	24391219	As shown in Fig. 2C, the levels of miR-155 and miR-21 were significantly higher in MDSC derived from the BM, spleen, or tumor tissue in tumor-bearing mice than those in control mice.
SEN:10041226	24652403	e ALDH1 activity in human PC (N = 11); representative flow cytometry plot of human PC tumor gated on live EpCAM+ cells using Aldefluor assay.
SEN:10041228	24652403	Furthermore, GCSFR-/- mice exhibit a shift in the immune profile of PC tumors from a TH-2 to TH-1 immune response, characterized by increased expression of IFN-y, TNF-a and IL-12 with decreased expression of arginase-1, IL-6, TGF-P, IL-10 compared to WT mice (Fig. 2d).
SEN:10041236	24652403	These monocytes acquired a Mo-MDSC phenotype characterized by a significantly decreased expression of HLA-DR and increased expression of arginase-1 as well as the ability to suppress CD8+ T cell proliferation in vitro [29-32] (Fig. 4a-c).
SEN:10041248	24652403	While we found that IL-6 mRNA gene expression was significantly downregulated by STAT3 inhibition (Supplementary figure 11), IL-6 blockade using anti-IL-6 antibodies decreased but did not fully reverse the effect of Mo-MDSC on increasing the prevalence of ALDH1Bright CSCs.
SEN:10041254	24733360	Rip2-deficient tumors showed enhanced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, with elevated expression of zebl, zeb2, twist, and snail in the tumor microenvironment.
SEN:10041276	24733360	The majority were associated with myeloid differentiation and chemotaxis, including G-CSF, M-CSF, IL-16, MCP-1, TREM-1, TIMP-1, and IL-1a with relative levels shown schematically [27-33] (Fig 4A).
SEN:10041280	24733360	Increased levels of IL-4, G-CSF, and GM-CSF were observed in bladder tumors from Rip2-deficient compared to wild-type mice, while no differences were detected in IFNy and M-CSF expression, consistent with a tumor microenvironment fostering development of the tumor associated MDSCs (Fig 4C).
SEN:10041282	24733360	To investigate the influence ofRip2 in development of EMT, we examined expression of adhesion markers in intravesical tumors and observed decreased E-cadherin expression throughout the tumor with concomitant increased N-cadherin expression at the peripheral of the tumor in Rip2-deficient relative to wild-type mice (Fig 6A).
SEN:10041284	24733360	Consistent with prior literature, we observed decreased canonical NF-kB activation exhibited by decreased p-IkB expression in Rip2-deficient tumors (Fig 6B), suggesting NF-kB independent mechanisms to account for EMT [39].
SEN:10041288	24733360	We also examined expression of these EMT inducing genes in lungs containing metastases from Rip2 wild-type and -deficient mice, revealing a similar trend with statistical significance for increased twist expression in absence of Rip2 (Fig 6D).
SEN:10041328	25063873	Blocking STAT3 activation with the small molecule inhibitor JSI-124 significantly inhibited the accumulation of NIK and IDO expression in MDSCs.
SEN:10041330	25063873	Knockdown of NIK in MDSCs suppressed IDO expression but not STAT3 activation.
SEN:10041332	25063873	RelB-p52 dimers were found to directly bind to the IDO promoter, leading to IDO expression in MDSCs.
SEN:10041334	25063873	STAT3 activation-induced IDO expression is independent of direct binding of STAT3 to the promoter region of IDO gene.
SEN:10041344	25063873	Blocking STAT3 activation by JSI-124 dramatically decreased the levels of p52 and RelB in nuclei (Fig. 2C, p < 0.05).
SEN:10041346	25063873	The level of STAT3 phosphorylation in MDSCs was reduced at 30 min and completely suppressed at 4 h after treatment with JSI-124.
SEN:10041348	25063873	Consistently, the level of NIK in MDSCs started to decline at 1 h and was completely blocked at 8 h after JSI-124 treatment.
SEN:10041350	25063873	The level of IDO significantly decreased at 4 h after JSI-124 treatment (Fig. 3A).
SEN:10041352	25063873	In NIK knockdown MDSCs, the level of IDO protein was reduced significantly, but the level of pSTAT3 protein was not affected (Fig. 3B, 3C).
SEN:10041354	25063873	In contrast, both IDO and NIK expression were reduced by JSI-124 treatment in MDSCs (Fig. 3A).
SEN:10041356	25063873	RelB/p52 dimers directly bind to the IDO promoter to regulate IDO expression in MDSCs.
SEN:10041366	25063873	We isolated CD11b+ MDSCs from the spleen of JSI-124-treated mice and found decreased expression of p-STAT3, NIK, and IDO protein in CD11b+ MDSCs compared with those isolated from the controls (Fig. 6D).
SEN:10041374	25063873	Furthermore, a specific IL-6-neutralizing Ab significantly decreased the levels of p-STAT3, NIK, and IDO in MDSCs (Fig. 7E, p < 0.05).
SEN:10041404	16288283	Shown are the representative results from one of three independent experiments done in triplicate as in a. (c) Tumor-infiltrating NK cells (CD49b+) and granulocytes (Gr1+) from wild-type mice showed increased phospho-Stat3 compared with their splenic counterparts.
SEN:10041406	16288283	Furthermore, examination of tumor-infiltrating DCs showed that expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, CD80 and CD86 is considerably increased in Stat3-/- mice when compared to those from Stat3+/+ mice (Fig. 2d).
SEN:10041410	16288283	Analysis of phosphorylated Stat3 by flow cytometry showed that Stat3 was also constitutively activated in tumor-infiltrating NK cells and neutrophils (Fig. 3c).
SEN:10041412	16288283	Flow cytometry and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) indicated that IL-10 activates Stat3 in NK cells (CD49b+CD3-) and granulocytes (Gr1+; Supplementary Fig. 3 online).
SEN:10041414	16288283	Furthermore, our data showed that FasL expression was increased in Stat3-/-Gr1+CD11b+ neutrophils (Supplementary Fig. 4 online).
SEN:10041426	16288283	We showed that CPA-7 inhibits Stat3 but not Statl and Stat5 in DC2.4 mouse DC line (Supplementary Fig. 6 online).
SEN:10041428	16288283	Tumor-infiltrating DCs from the mice receiving CPA-7 24 h earlier showed considerably reduced phosphorylated Stat3 compared to vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 6b).
SEN:10041456	17312132	Treatment of 1D11 also reduced the conversion of CD4+ T cells into Treg cells and subsequent Treg cell-mediated suppression of antitumor immunity.
SEN:10041458	17312132	In summary, we havedemonstrated that tumor cells directly convert CD4+CD25_ T cells to Treg cells through production of high levels of TGF-^,suggesting a possible mechanism through which tumor cells evade the immune system.
SEN:10041460	17312132	More importantly, Foxp3+CD25+ T cells were also detected at the tumor sites (Fig. 1B).
SEN:10041462	17312132	These results suggest that coculture of purified CD4+CD25~ T cells with tumor cells TRAMP-C2, but not nontumorigenic NRP-152 cells, induces CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells.
SEN:10041464	17312132	Moreover, these results provide evidence that tumor cells can indeed directly convert CD4+CD25~ T cells into Treg cells.
SEN:10041466	17312132	In agreement with RT-PCR results, FACS analysis demonstrated increased protein expression levels of Foxp3 in T cells cultured in TRAMP-C2 CM (CM) as the Ctrl 25+ ; however, CD4+CD25~ T cells cultured with T cell medium (Ctrl) did not express Foxp3 (Fig. 2D, bottom panel).
SEN:10041468	17312132	T cells cultured with TRAMP-C2 CM (CM) produced virtually nondetectable amounts of IL-2, whereas T cells cultured with T cell medium (Ctrl) produced high levels of IL-2 (Fig. 3A).
SEN:10041470	17312132	In addition, T cells cultured with CM produced high levels of IL-10 and TGF-0 as compared with T cells cultured with T cell medium (Fig. 3, B and C).
SEN:10041472	17312132	T cells cultured with tumor cell CM suppress CD4+CD25~ T cell proliferation Next, the suppressive ability of T cells cultured with CM was examined in an in vitro functional assay.
SEN:10041474	17312132	T cells cultured with CM derived from tumor cells TRAMP-C2 or RENCA (CM/25_) suppressed CD4+CD25~ T cell proliferation, whereas T cells cultured with T cell medium (Ctrl/25_) did not (Fig. 4, A, C, and D).
SEN:10041476	17312132	The results indicated that tumor cells produced high levels of TGF-^, whereas the nontumorigenic NRP-152 and irradiated TRAMP-C2 cells had significantly lower TGF-^ production (Fig. 4E).
SEN:10041478	17312132	Furthermore, neutralization of TGF-^ completely changed the profile of cytokine production of these T cells, and cells now expressed high levels of IL-2 and low levels of IL-10 and TGF-^ (Fig. 3).
SEN:10041482	17312132	Taken together, these results have revealed a critical role of tumor-derived TGF-^ in conversion of CD4+CD25~ T cells into Treg cells.
SEN:10041490	17312132	However, immunofluorescence staining revealed that Foxp3 expression was absent in animals receiving 1D11 and present in animals receiving no treatment or control Ab 13C4 (Fig. 6A).
SEN:10041492	17312132	These results suggest tumor-derived TGF-^ converts CD4+ T cells into CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg cells in the tumor microenvironment and neutralization of TGF-^ using 1D11 abolished the conversion.
SEN:10041494	17804750	The forkhead transcription factor Foxp3 is highly expressed in CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Treg) and was recently identified as a key player in mediating their inhibitory functions.
SEN:10041496	17804750	Foxp3 expression was induced by transforming growth factor-(32 (TGF-(32), but not TGF-(31 stimulation in these cells, and was partially suppressed following antibody-mediated neutralization of TGF-(32.
SEN:10041498	17804750	Down-regulation of Foxp3 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) in pancreatic carcinoma cells resulted in the up-regulation of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-8 expression, providing evidence for a negative transcriptional activity of Foxp3 also in these epithelial cells.
SEN:10041500	17804750	Coculture of Foxp3-expressing tumor cells with naive T cells completely inhibited T-cell proliferation, but not activation, and this antiproliferative effect was partially abrogated following specific inhibition of Foxp3 expression.
SEN:10041502	17804750	In an initial analysis of microdissected pancreatic carcinoma tissue using Affymetrix chip technology, Foxp3 was among the up-regulated genes in some tumor samples (26); (Fig. 1A).
SEN:10041504	17804750	In accordance with the immunohistochemistry data pointing to FoxP3 expression in tumor cells (see above), Foxp3 expression was clearly detectable in several pancreatic carcinoma cell lines at both mRNA (Fig. 2A) and protein levels (Fig. 2B).
SEN:10041506	17804750	Treatment of PANC-89, Capan1, and Panc1 cells with TGF-h2 led to an up-regulation of the Foxp3 protein, which was moderate for PANC-89 and Capan1 and strong for Panc1 (Fig. 3A and D).
SEN:10041508	17804750	RT-PCR analysis detected a 13-fold (mean value of four independent experiments) increase of Foxp3 mRNA expression in PANC-89 cells after a 48-h stimulation with TGF-h2, whereas no such effect was evident after stimulation with TGF-h1 (Fig. 3B).
SEN:10041510	17804750	Moreover, the incubation of PANC-89 and Capan1 cells with anti-TGF-h2 antibody for 48 h clearly suppressed the Foxp3 signal (Fig. 3A ), suggesting that endogenously produced TGF-h2 maintains Foxp3 expression in pancreatic cancer cell cultures.
SEN:10041512	17804750	Specific down-regulation of Foxp3 in pancreatic carcinoma cells results in up-regulation of IL-6 and IL-8.
SEN:10041514	17804750	A screen for changes in cytokine secretion in these cells using the Raybiotec Cytokine Array (Hoelzel Diagnostica) revealed an increase of IL-6 and IL-8 in the culture supernatant, whereas other cytokines remained unchanged (data not shown).
SEN:10041518	17804750	In the cocultures, Colo357, PANC-89, and PancTu1 tumor cells strongly inhibited the proliferation of anti-CD3/anti-CD28-stimulated T cells (Fig. 4D).
SEN:10041520	17804750	As shown in Fig. 5B, CD25 GITR and CD69 were up-regulated after anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimulation, irrespective of the presence or absence of tumor cells.
SEN:10041522	17804750	When using these cells, we observed an ~ 45% recovery of T-cell proliferation in the coculture system (Fig. 5A).
SEN:10041530	20661468	TMV induce and promote proliferation of Treg
SEN:10041534	20661468	In cultures containing TMV, Treg expressing GITR, CTLA-4, FasL, CCR7, TGF-P1, Granzyme B, and perforin were increased (p<0.05 for all).
SEN:10041544	20661468	In addition, intracytoplasmic expression of phosphorylated SMAD2/3 and phosphorylated STAT3 in Treg was increased in the presence of TMV relative to Treg incubated in the absence of TMV (Figure 7C).
SEN:10041546	21217015	These results demonstrate that the TLR1/TLR2 agonist BLP may have a general tumor therapeutic property involving reciprocal downregulation of Treg and upregulation of CTL function.
SEN:10041550	21217015	CD8+ T cells isolated from BLP-treated tumor-bearing mice exhibited vigorous proliferation upon in vitro restimulation with 3LL tumor cells, whereas CD8+ T cells isolated from PBS-treated mice failed to do so (Fig. 2A).
SEN:10041552	21217015	Whereas PBS-treated Tregs retained their function and effectively suppressed CTL proliferation, BLP-treated Tregs lost their suppressive function, resulting in a marked CTL expansion in vitro (Fig. 3B).
SEN:10041554	21217015	BLP-treated Tregs from WT but not TLR2_/_ mice lost their suppressive function, as demonstrated indirectly by the increased CTL numbers in the DLNs and the higher levels of serum IL-2 and IFN-g found in mice receiving BLP-treated WT as compared with TLR2_/_ Tregs, regardless of whether the cotransferred CTL were from either WT or TLR2_/_ mice (Fig. 4B, 4C).
SEN:10041642	24949077	The mRNA expression of Foxp3 and RORyt in the spleen was very low in the normal control group but significantly higher in the model control group (P < 0.05).
SEN:10041646	24949077	SOCS3 protein expression was significantly downregulated in all groups except for the normal control group (P < 0.05).
SEN:10041648	24949077	Jak2 and STAT3 protein expression was significantly higher in the model control group than in all other groups (P < 0.05).
SEN:10041650	25080445	We found that PI3K-Akt pathway inhibitors selectively inhibit Tregs with minimal effect on conventional T cells (Tconv).
SEN:10041656	25080445	In tumors treated with the combination of MK-2206 with the vaccine, a significantly higher number of CD8+ T cells were detected in comparison with that of the nontreated group (P < 0.001; Fig. 5B).
SEN:10041704	25168696	Using the diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced rat liver tumor model and in vitro cell experiments, the percentage of CD4+CD25+Treg/CD4+ cells in the blood and the expressions of Foxp3+, IL-10, TGF-p, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4(CTLA-4) in spleen and liver tumors significantly decreased after LDR of the spleen in rats with liver cancer.
SEN:10041718	25168696	LDR reduces CTLA-4 expression on the CD4+CD25+Treg cell surface and inhibits CD4+CD25+Treg cell suppression of CD4+CD25-T cells CD4+CD25-T cells significantly proliferated because of the effects of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 stimulating factors.
SEN:10041720	25168696	This proliferation of CD4+CD25-T cells significantly decreased after the addition of antogenous CD4+CD25+T cells in a co-culture for 3 d, which indicates significant inhibition of CD4+CD25-T cell proliferation by the CD4+CD25+T cells.
SEN:10041722	25168696	After the addition of TGF-b or IL-10 blockers, CD4+CD25-T cell proliferation increased, and OD values increased from 0.54 Â± 0.028 to 0.58 Â±0.026 with no significant difference, although the addition of anti-TGF-P and anti-1L-10 decreased the inhibition function of CD4+CD25+T cells (Fig. 7D).
SEN:10041730	9023347	Hypoxia was capable of inducing VEGF mRNA in both immortalized and transformed endothelial cells (4.5-fold in cells expressing SV40 large T antigen alone or in combination with H-ras), but both baseline and induced VEGF mRNA expression was increased in cells containing activated ras (Fig. 4).
SEN:10041732	9023347	Treatment of cells with wortmannin, a steroidal inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (15), resulted in a decreased level of VEGF under hypoxic conditions but the fold stimulation of VEGF mRNA was not changed (Fig. 5).
SEN:10041734	9023347	Cells with activated ras demonstrated high level of expression of 72-kDa metalloproteinase (MMP-2, gelatinase A), and 92-kDa metalloproteinase (MMP-9, gelatinase B) compared with cells containing SV40 large T antigen alone.
SEN:10041736	9023347	Treatment of ras-containing cells with wortmannin resulted in a decrease in MMP expression (Fig. 6).
SEN:10041744	9023347	Since wortmannin inhibits VEGF and MMP activity, but does not restore TIMP activity, tumor-igenesis is not expected to be fully suppressed.
SEN:10041748	9023347	Wortmannin could inhibit ras-mediated induction of VEGF, but it did not inhibit the hypoxic regulation of VEGF.
SEN:10041750	9023347	This suggests that the hypoxic regulation of VEGF is independent of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase.
SEN:10041766	12842087	Mice deficient in matrix metalloproteinase-9, which cleaves tumstatin efficiently from Col IVa3, have decreased circulating tumstatin and accelerated growth of tumor.
SEN:10041774	12842087	We observed increased angiogenesis in the Col IVa3/tumstatin-deficient mice, as compared to the wild-type mice (Figure 2B).
SEN:10041778	12842087	Col IVa3/tumstatin-deficient mice had increased circulating VEGFR2-positive endothelial cells (Figure 2D).
SEN:10041796	16204059	Here, we show that ras-transformed cancer cells can also induce TSP-1 down-regulation in their adjacent nontransformed stromal fibroblasts, but not in endothelial cells, in a paracrine and distance-dependent manner.
SEN:10041800	16204059	Indeed, MDF528 nontransformed dermal fibroblasts, like many other types of normal nonangiogenic cells (12), express copious amounts of TSP-1 (Fig. 1B, lane 1), which becomes undetectable in their H-ras -expressing counterparts (528ras1 cells; Fig. 1B, lane 2; refs.
SEN:10041802	16204059	Down-regulation of thrombospondin-1 promoter activity in nontumorigenic dermal fibroblasts exposed to tumor cell-derived soluble mediator(s).
SEN:10041804	16204059	Interestingly, exposure of MDF-EGFP/TSP-1 fibroblasts to conditioned medium derived rom H-ras-expressing 528ras1 cancer cells (528ras1 conditioned medium) induced a near complete inhibition of GFP fluorescence as indicated by both confocal microscopy and flow cytometry (Fig. 2C, left).
SEN:10041806	16204059	Again, this effect was paralleled by comparable decreases in TSP-1 mRNA and protein expression in these cells exposed to 528ras1 conditioned medium (Fig. 2C).
SEN:10041808	16204059	In addition to the aforementioned paracrine properties of 528ras1 cells, we observed that also conditioned medium of human colorectal cancer cells harboring a mutant K-ras oncogene (DLD-1), but not that of a DLD-1 variant with genetically disrupted K-ras allele (DKO-3 cells), efficiently suppressed the activity of the TSP-1 reporter gene in MDF-EGFP/ TSP-1 cells (Fig. 4A).
SEN:10041810	16204059	Once again, we observed that expression of TSP-1 by the nontransformed MDFB6 fibroblasts was precipitously down-regulated when these cells were incubated with B6ras conditioned medium (Fig. 5A).
SEN:10041812	16204059	A, immortalized dermal fibroblasts (MDFB6) down-regulate TSP-1 protein expression in the presence of conditioned medium from their H-ras-transformed counterparts (B6ras CM); quantification of representative Western blot.
SEN:10041814	16204059	B, absence of TSP-1 down-regulation in Id1-deficient dermal fibroblasts exposed to conditioned medium of ras-transformed (528ras1 CM and B6ras CM) and neu-transformed (528neu CM) tumor cells.
SEN:10041816	16204059	Paracrine effects of various ras-driven cancer cells were detected at the level of TSP-1 protein, mRNA, and promoter activity (Fig. 2C).
SEN:10041820	16204059	In contrast, abrogation of TSP-1 suppression was observed (Fig. 6C) when MDF528 cells were incubated with dimethylsphingosine, a specific inhibitor of sphingosine kinase.
SEN:10041822	16204059	Thus, suppression of TSP-1 promoter activity by fraction 2 of 528ras1 conditioned medium was moderately sensitive to pertussis toxin but was completely abolished by dimethylsphingosine.
SEN:10041826	16352631	Results G-CSF treatment increased WBCs and neutrophils in peripheral blood and reduced the bone marrow SDF-1 level We treated mice with N-terminal-mutated recombinant human G-CSF, nartograstim (8 ig kg_1), and examined the number of total WBCs and neutrophils in peripheral blood to confirm its biological effects.
SEN:10041828	16352631	G-CSF treatment did not change the serum SDF-1 level (Fig. 1B), but 4 Mechanism of tumor angiogenesis activated by G-CSF significantly reduced the bone marrow SDF-1 level (Fig. 1C) as previously shown (21).
SEN:10041834	16352631	G-CSF treatment induced the increase of vessel density in tumor tissues, but did not affect the proliferation of HUVECs Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the tumor tissues revealed hyper-neovascularization in tumors from G-CSF-treated mice (Fig. 3A and C; total of six G-CSF injections).
SEN:10041836	16352631	Compared with control mice, we found an increase of tumor vessel density in G-CSF-treated mice.
SEN:10041844	16489015	These antagonists prevented monocyte stimulation of angiogenesis in vivo, macrophage colonization of tumors, and tumor angiogenesis.
SEN:10041846	16489015	In contrast to most normal tissues, tumors have a high macrophage content; an average of 199 + 33 F4/80+ macrophages per field can be observed in Lewis lung carcinoma tumors and an average of 61 + 1 F4/80+ macrophages per field can be observed in HT29 xenograft tumors grown in mice (Fig. 1A and B).
SEN:10041850	16489015	Integrin A4B1 mediates myeloid cell adhesion to endothelium in vitro.
SEN:10041852	16489015	Antagonists of a4h1 blocked monocyte attachment to VCAM, indicating that integrin a4h1 is a functionally active receptor for both CS-1 fibronectin and VCAM (Supplementary Fig. S4).
SEN:10041854	16489015	Treatment with integrin a4h1 antagonists, but not other antagonists, significantly suppressed the number of F4/80+ macrophages within tumors (Fig. 6A and B).
SEN:10041856	16489015	These antagonists also reduced blood vessel density within treated tumors (Fig. 6C and D) and partially suppressed tumor growth (Supplementary Fig. S5).
SEN:10041864	16510581	FBLN-3 expression in MB114 cells also prevented their activation of p38 MAPK, but not that of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), stimulated by VEGF (Fig. 2E).
SEN:10041866	16510581	Figure 3A shows that relative to control cells, FBLN-3 and FBLN-5 both decreased MB114 cell expression of MMP-2 and MMP-3 while simultaneously increasing that of the MMP antagonists, TIMP-1 and TIMP-3.
SEN:10041868	16510581	Although MB114 cell expression of TIMP-2 was unaffected by either FBLN-3 or FBLN-5, both FBLNs induced MB114 cell expression of the angiostatic molecule, TSP-1 (Fig. 3A).
SEN:10041870	16510581	Interestingly, although TIMP-3 expression was elevated basally in FBLN-5-expressing MB114 cells, only FBLN-3 stimulated TIMP-3 expression in tubulating MB114 cells (Fig. 3B).
SEN:10041872	16510581	Gelatin zymography of MB114 cell conditioned medium confirmed that expression of either FBLN-3 or FBLN-5 significantly reduced MMP-2 protease activity in tubulating MB114 cells (Fig. 3C).
SEN:10041874	16510581	FBLN-3 and FBLN-5 antagonize angiogenesis in vivo.
SEN:10041878	16510581	Moreover, recombinant FBLN-3 and FBLN-5 (Fig. 4B) both inhibited human HMEC-1 endothelial cell migration to fibronectin (Fig. 4C), whereas FBLN-5, but not FBLN-3, mediated their adhesion in an RGD-dependent manner (Fig. 4D; refs.
SEN:10041880	16510581	Figure 5A shows that bFGF stimulated significant vascularization of implanted Matrigel plugs, which was quantified by measuring plug hemoglobin contents (Fig. 5A) and microvessel densities (Fig. 5B).
SEN:10041890	16510581	More importantly, tumors derived from FBLN-expressing MCA102 fibrosarcoma cells also exhibited significantly reduced blood vessel densities compared with tumors derived from control cells (Fig. 6D ).
SEN:10041892	16510581	In addition, FBLN-3-expressing MCA102 tumors contained significantly enlarged regions of central and peripheral necrosis that were typically absent in their control counterparts.
SEN:10041896	17018627	DLD-1 human colon cancer cells that secrete ;C or ;C399tr grew at similar levels in vitro but grew much slower in vivo than mock-transfected cells.
SEN:10041898	17018627	The recombinant purified ;C399tr fragment markedly suppressed tumor growth, development of intra-tumoral vasculature, and tumor metastasis in vivo in the highly metastatic Met-1 breast cancer model.
SEN:10041902	17018627	gC induced caspase-3 activation in 8 hours in these cells in Matrigel (Fig. 2C).
SEN:10041904	17018627	DLD-1 colon carcinoma cells engineered to secrete ;C or ;C399tr grew slower than nonsecreting control cells in SCID mice.
SEN:10041908	17018627	;C399tr blocked the tumor growth, intratumoral vascularization, and metastasis of the highly metastatic Met-1 breast cancer in nude mice.
SEN:10041972	18056450	Hesl and Heyl mRNA was significantly increased in U87 cells (DLL4 cells versus EV cells, P < 0.01 for both genes; Supplementary Fig. S1C).
SEN:10041974	18056450	Similarly, expression of mouse Hesl (mHesl) and mHey2 was also increased in B16 cells (DLL4 cells versus EV cells, P < 0.05 for both genes).
SEN:10041980	18056450	For U87 xenograft tumors, mDLL4 expressed in tumor ECs and mHesl expressed in host stromal/endothelial cells were significantly increased in tumors overexpressing DLL4 (both P < 0.05).
SEN:10041982	18056450	In contrast, for B16 allograft tumors, all tested genes were significantly increased in DLL4-overexpressing tumors (P < 0.05).
SEN:10041984	18056450	In contrast, DLL4-overexpressing tumors displayed decreased vessel density and vessel number, yet exhibited larger vessels with large lumina (Fig. 3A ).
SEN:10041988	18056450	Double staining for hypoxyprobe-1 (pimonidazole) and mCD31 showed much reduced regions of intratumoral hypoxia in DLL4-overexpressing U87 tumors, significantly less than those in EV control tumors (5% compared with 18%; P < 0.01; Fig. 3C).
SEN:10041990	18056450	As shown in Fig. 3D, in vivo expression of mouse VEGFR2 protein in the large vessels was lower in DLL4-overexpressing U87 tumors compared with those of EV control tumors, suggesting that the large vessels were particularly modulated by the DLL4 signal.
SEN:10041994	18056450	Immunostaining for activated caspase-3, a marker of apoptosis, showed that the number of apoptotic cells was decreased in DLL4-overexpressing tumors compared with EV control tumors (P < 0.01; Fig. 3C).
SEN:10041998	18056450	Interestingly, hypoxia significantly increased VEGF production of PC3 (P < 0.05) but not U87 cells (P > 0.05) compared with normoxia.
SEN:10042006	18056450	However, there were residual well-organized large vessels with regular shape and large lumina in DLL4-overexpressing tumors after bevacizumab treatment (Fig. 4D).
SEN:10042010	18713838	Along these lines, Oncomine analyses comparing the gene expression profiles of 40 breast carcinomas versus seven normal breast tissues also found FBLN5 messenger RNA expression to be reduced in mammary tumors as compared with their normal counterparts (Figure 1A).
SEN:10042012	18713838	In stark contrast, we observed human breast cancers to contain abundant levels of FBLN5 protein, and in fact, to express more FBLN5 protein than did their normal counterparts (Figure 1B and C).
SEN:10042018	18713838	Indeed, actin cytoskeletal rearrangements (Figure 2B, red channel) were readily apparent in NMuMG that expressed FBLN5 (Figure 2B, green channel), which contrasted sharply with the normal cuboidal morphologies and cortical actin architectures exhibited by adjacent NMuMG cells that failed to express the FBLN5 transgene (Figure 2B).
SEN:10042022	18713838	Similarly, FBLN5 expression also enhanced the resting and TGF-P-stimulated EMT in 4T1 breast cancer cells (Figure 2C), suggesting that the oncogenic activities of FBLN5 are not restricted to NMuMG cells.
SEN:10042026	18713838	Moreover, we found that EMT stimulated by TGF-P (Figure 2E) or the process of mammary tumorigenesis (Figure 2F) both induced Twist expression, and more importantly, that FBLN5 significantly enhanced resting and TGF-P-stimulated Twist expression in normal and malignant MECs (Figure 2E and F).
SEN:10042034	18713838	Functionally, FBLN5 enhanced the EMT phenotype in normal (Figure 5A) and malignant (Figure 5B) MECs, as well as significantly augmented their tonic and TGF-P-stimulated invasion through synthetic basement membranes (Figure 5C; data not shown).
SEN:10042040	18713838	As above, both transcriptional responses mediated by FBLN5 were reversed by treating the cells with the type I MMP-2/3 or MMP-2/9 inhibitors (Figure 5D and E).
SEN:10042048	19967723	Mechanistically, endothelial a6-integrin deficiency elevated significantly VEGF-mediated angiogenesis both in vivo and ex vivo.
SEN:10042050	19967723	In particular, a6-integrin-deficient endothelial cells displayed increased levels of VEGF-receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and VEGF-mediated downstream ERK1/2 activation.
SEN:10042052	19967723	Blood vessels associated with IDC showed a significant reduction in mean a6-integrin pixel intensity when compared with blood vessels from normal breast tissue (**p < 0.0001, Figure 1b).
SEN:10042058	19967723	The results showed that there was a significant increase in tumour blood vessel density in a6fl/fl-Tie1Cre+ mice compared with a6fl/fl-Tie1Cre- controls (*p < 0.02, Figure 3b).
SEN:10042064	19967723	As predicted, the absence of a6-integrin reduced the ability of the a6-/â cells to adhere and migrate to Lm but did not affect the ability of these cells to adhere or migrate on Fn, Col or Vn (*p < 0.05, Figures 5c and 5d).
SEN:10042068	19967723	Western blot analysis revealed that VEGF stimulated the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in both a6fl/fl-Tie1Cre-and a6fl/fl-Tie1Cre+ endothelial cells and that the levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) detected in a6fl/fl-Cre+ endothelial cells after a VEGF stimulus were dramatically higher than those detected in a6fl/flTie1Cre- endothelial cells (Figure 6b).
SEN:10042070	19967723	Furthermore, blockade of VEGFR2 using the function blocking monoclonal antibody to VEGFR2, DC101 [26], ablated these enhanced VEGF-mediated responses, demonstrating that the enhanced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was via VEGFR2 (Figure 6b).
SEN:10042074	20027628	MMP-2 transcriptional suppression decreased VEGF, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) protein levels and AKT phosphorylation in lung cancer cells.
SEN:10042076	20027628	In addition, MMP-2 suppression decreased hypoxia inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a), a transcription factor for VEGF, as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA).
SEN:10042080	20027628	Moreover, A549 xenograft tissue sections from mice that treated with MMP-2 siRNA showed reduced expression of VEGF and the angiogenic marker, factor-VIII.
SEN:10042082	20027628	MMP-2 gelatinolytic activity was higher in cells infected with PBS (mock) and Ad-SV.
SEN:10042084	20027628	Further, we also show that Ad-MMP-2-Si inhibits MMP-2 protein and mRNA levels in NCI-H1299, another adenocarcinoma cell line (Supporting Information Fig. 1).
SEN:10042090	20027628	Ad-MMP-2-Si inhibits VEGF-mediated angiogenesis in vitro.
SEN:10042092	20027628	MMP-2 inhibition decreased VEGF shedding into TCM as compared to mock and Ad-SV-infected cells.
SEN:10042094	20027628	The extent of VEGF secretion into the TCM in Ad-MMP-2-Si-infected A549 cells was 2.01 Â± 0.15 pg/lg (p < 0.01) as compared to 7.22 Â± 0.84 pg/lg in Ad-SV-infected cells (Fig. 2b).
SEN:10042096	20027628	Western blot analysis indicated that VEGF and VEGFR-2 protein expression was decreased in Ad-MMP-2-Si-infected cells as compared to mock and Ad-SV-infected cells (Fig. 2c).
SEN:10042098	20027628	Ad-MMP-2-Si infection inhibited VEGF and VEGFR-2 expression by >85% (p < 0.01) and 65.00 Â± 4.45% (p < 0.05), respectively.
SEN:10042100	20027628	As shown in Figure 2d, Ad-MMP-2-Si infection inhibited VEGF and VEGFR-2 mRNA transcription by 89.65 Â± 2.01% (p < 0.01) and 68.65 Â± 2.44% (p < 0.05), respectively.
SEN:10042104	20027628	As shown in Figure 5, rhMMP-2 restored Ad-MMP-2-Si-mediated inhibition of VEGF expression from 15.55 Â± 6.21% (p < 0.01) to 67.96 Â± 4.01% (p < 0.01).
SEN:10042108	20027628	These results suggest that MMP-2 downregulation inhibits expression of VEGF at the mRNA transcription level in A549 cells.
SEN:10042110	20027628	Ad-MMP-2-Si inhibits HIF-1a expression and activity in A549 cells A key stimulus for increased VEGF expression in lung cancer is hypoxia.
SEN:10042112	20027628	We could not detect HIF-1a expression under normoxic conditions; however, HIF-1 a was detected in A549 cells exposed to hypoxia (1% O2) for 12-16 hr.
SEN:10042114	20027628	As Figure 3a shows, Ad-MMP-2-Si infection inhibited HIF-1a expression by 96.13 Â± 1.98% (p < 0.01) when compared to the controls.
SEN:10042116	20027628	As shown in Figure 3b, Ad-MMP-2-Si infection inhibited HIF-1a mRNA transcription by 81.21 Â± 3.47% (p < 0.01) as compared to the controls.
SEN:10042118	20027628	As shown Figure 3c, HIF-1a activity substantially decreased in Ad-MMP-2-Si-infected A549 cells as compared to mock and Ad-SV infected cells.
SEN:10042120	20027628	As shown in Figure 4a, Ad-MMP-2-Si infection inhibited the expression of PI3K and phosphorylation of AKT (Ser-473) by 94.7 Â± 1.95% (p < 0.01) and 98.9 Â± 1.02% (p < 0.01), respectively.
SEN:10042122	20027628	As shown in Figure 4b, ectopic expression of constitutively active-AKT restored AKT phosphorylation and VEGF expression in Ad-MMP-2-Si-infected A549 cells.
SEN:10042126	20027628	The addition of rhMMP-2 to Ad-MMP-2-Si-infected A549 cells restored PI3K expression (from 13.25 Â± 2.36%; p < 0.01 to 40.11 Â± 2.32%; p < 0.01), phospho-AKT (from 9.45 Â± 4.21% p < 0.01 to 60.22 Â± 3.33%; p < 0.01) and VEGF (from 15.55 Â± 6.21%; p < 0.01 to 67.96 Â± 4.01%; p < 0.01) in A549 cell line (Fig. 5a).
SEN:10042140	20027628	Addition of rhMMP-2 markedly increased the phosphorylation of AKT and expression of PI3K and VEGF in mock and Ad-MMP-2-Si-infected cells (Fig. 6e) as compared to cells treated with Ad-MMP-2-Si only.
SEN:10042142	20027628	Ad-MMP-2-Si treatment inhibits VEGF expression and reduces blood vessel density in vivo We next sought to determine the effect of Ad-MMP-2-Si treatment on VEGF expression and angiogenesis in vivo.
SEN:10042186	22075979	Although in LLC the vascular density remained unaffected, a significant decrease in vascular density had occurred in B16.F10 tumors (Fig. 2e and f).
SEN:10042188	22075979	Treatment significantly reduced the overall CD31-positive surface area of B16.F10 tumors by approximately 2-fold, which was confirmed by a 3-fold reduction in mRNA levels of the endothelial marker molecules CD31 and VE-cadherin in the tumor (Fig. 2g and h).
SEN:10042190	22075979	VEGFR2/EGFR inhibitor therapy significantly down-regulated mRNA expression of the proangiogenic/vascular destabilization molecules integrin p3 and Ang2 3-fold and significantly upregulated mRNA levels of the vascular stability molecules Tie2 and N-cadherin approximately 3-fold in LLC (Fig. 3).
SEN:10042192	22075979	Furthermore, an approximately 1.5-fold decrease in PDGFRp expression was observed in LLC tumor vasculature upon vandetanib treatment, as well as a 9-fold upregulation of desmin, which, however, did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.08) because of interindividual variation between the mice.
SEN:10042194	22075979	In contrast, vandetanib treatment induced a 2.3-fold increase in eNOS mRNA in B16.F10 vasculature.
SEN:10042196	22075979	Strikingly, VEGFR2 staining was strongly diminished after treatment in both LLC and B16.F10 tumors (Fig. 5aâl).
SEN:10042198	22075979	Vandetanib treatment also reduced EGFR expression, although this reduction was less pronounced than for VEGFR2.
SEN:10042202	22952847	Transcriptional reprogramming of tumors via DmiR-580, 588 or 190 over-expression resulted in downregulation of pro-angiogenic factors such as TIMP-3, bFGF and TGFalpha.
SEN:10042206	22952847	Figure 2D shows the high rate of proliferative Ki67+ cells in a representative dormant miR-588 expressing A-GBM tumor at day 113 post injection.
SEN:10042214	22952847	We found that antiangiogenic and dormancy promoting genes, Angiomotin (AMOT-1) and Eph receptor A5 (EphA5), were both upregulated in all DmiR expressing A-GBM tumors as compared to the GFP-vector- control A-GBM cells (Figure 4).
SEN:10042216	22952847	In contrast, genes involved in pro-angiogenic signaling, including tissue inhibitor of metalloprotei-nases 3 (TIMP-3), hypoxia-induced factor 1 alpha (HIF-1-alpha), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, FGF2), and the K-ras tumor oncogene, were consistently downregulated in DmiR expressing A-GBM.
SEN:10042218	22952847	Importantly, we found Bv8 also known as prokineticin 2 (Prok2) to be markedly downregulated in all three DmiR expressing A-GBM (Figure 5A).
SEN:10042226	22952847	Over-expression of miR-580, miR-588 and miR-190 in fast-growing angiogenic glioblastoma.
SEN:10042236	23131846	In contrast, VEGF plugs in Pld1~-~ mice exhibited almost no vascularization (Fig. 2, A and B).
SEN:10042240	23131846	PLD1 deficiency reduced basal phosphorylation of Ser473 in Akt and prevented VEGF-induced phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 (Fig. 3, C and D).
SEN:10042242	23131846	Pldl-- endothelial cells similarly exhibited a 50% reduction in basal phosphorylation of ERK1/2 but otherwise exhibited similar kinetics to wild-type cells for VEGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2.
SEN:10042248	23131846	Histological and quantitative analyses of the tumors revealed a 79% decrease in microvessels in the tumors that formed in FIPI-treated mice (Fig. 4C).
SEN:10042272	23640055	Against this background, we conducted in vitro phosphorylation studies of the phosphorylation of in-tegrin avp3 dimer with activated ERK1 and found phosphorylation of the dimer (Fig. 3A) that was inhibited by the ERK inhibitor, FR180204.
SEN:10042278	23640055	Integrin av bound to the COX-2 promoter in both OVCAR-3 and H522 cells in response to T4 (Fig. 4A)
SEN:10042282	23640055	These results suggest that although T4 increased complex formation between integrin av and NCoR/SMRT, the association between NCoR/SMRT and DNA was unchanged.
SEN:10042284	23640055	The transcription of COX-2, ERa, HIF-la, and TR$1 was increased in thyroid hormone-treated cells (Fig. 4B).
SEN:10042292	23792174	TGFBI inhibited vitronectin-induced HUVEC migration on Boy-den chambers coated with vitronectin and this inhibition was reversed by treatment with the functional blocking monoclonal antibody against TGFBI (Fig. 1E, Supplementary Fig. 2B).
SEN:10042298	23792174	FAS1_D1234 protein, lacking the RGD motif and EMI domain, bound effectively to avp3 integrin with an affinity of 340 nM, indicating that the four repeats of the FAS1 domain coordinate with the RGD motif to achieve strong and specific binding to av(33 integrin.
SEN:10042300	23792174	Furthermore, upon deletion of FAS1 domains 1 and 2, affinity was decreased by 255-fold to 86.84 |aM, whereas deletion of FAS1 domains 3 and 4 only decreased binding affinity by 2.1-fold to 715 nM, implying that FAS1_D12 domains play a critical role in binding to avp3 integrin.
SEN:10042308	23792174	Blood vessel density (vascular volume/tumor volume) was also reduced by 2.2-fold in the TGFBI-treated group (Fig. 5D).
SEN:10042322	999999999	RBP2 stimulated the up-regulation of VEGF, which was dependent on HIF-1a, and activated the HIF-1a via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway.
SEN:10042324	999999999	RBP2 was detected as being overexpressed in 52 (51%) of 102 NSCLC specimens according to the abovementioned criteria.
SEN:10042326	999999999	2. RBP2 is overexpressed in human NSCLC cell lines.
SEN:10042328	999999999	The protein level of RBP2 was up-regulated in lung cancer cell lines SK-MES-1, A549, SPCA-1 and H1975 compared to the human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS2B (Fig. 3A).
SEN:10042330	999999999	Down-regulation of RBP2 protein decreases the expression levels of VEGF in conditioned medium.
SEN:10042332	999999999	The results demonstrated that the VEGF protein levels in the conditioned media of RBP2-siRNA1 (0.9960.11 ng/ml) and RBP2-siRNA2 (0.9460.14 ng/ml) H1975 cells were significantly lower than in the control siRNA H1975 cells (1.8760.10
SEN:10042336	999999999	PRBP2 stimulates HIF-1a and VEGF mRNA and protein expression.
SEN:10042338	999999999	As shown in Fig. 5A, the enforced expression of RBP2 up-regulated the expression of the HIF-1 a protein in a time-dependent manner under normoxic conditions, and the peak value of HIF-1 a expression appeared at 36 hours after transfection was performed.
SEN:10042340	999999999	RBP2 is overexpressed in human NSCLC cell lines SK-MES-1, A549, SPCA-1 and H1975 compared to the human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS2B cells.
SEN:10042342	999999999	As shown in Fig. 5B and Fig. 5C, the down-regulation of RBP2 in H1975 cells led to the decreased expression of HIF-1a and VEGF, whereas ectopic RBP2 expression in SK-MES-1 cells by pcDNA3-HA-RBP2 led to the up-regulation of HIF-1a and VEGF.
SEN:10042344	999999999	The mRNA expression levels of HIF-1a (PsiRNA1 =0.006, PsiRNA2 = 0.001) and VEGF (PsiRNA1 =0.000, PsiRNA2 = 0.000) were significantly decreased in RBP2-depleted H1975 cells.
SEN:10042346	999999999	Moreover, HIF-1a (P = 0.001) and VEGF (P = 0.000) were increased in RBP2-overexpressing SK-MES-1 cells compared to the control cells (Fig. 5D and Fig. 5E).
SEN:10042348	999999999	As shown in Fig. 6A and Fig. 6B, knockdown of HIF-1a expression in ectopic RBP2-expressing SK-MES-1 cells led to the down-regulation of VEGF compared with the scramble non-specific control siRNA; up-regulation of HIF-1a expression in RBP2-depleted H1975 cells led to the up-regulation of VEGF.
SEN:10042350	999999999	Our results revealed that silencing RBP2 expression with either RBP2-siRNA1 or RBP2-siRNA2 in H1975 cells significantly decreased the phosphorylation of Akt, whereas the forced expression of RBP2 with pcDNA3-HA-RBP2 in SK-MES-1 cells increased the activity of Akt (Fig. 7A).
SEN:10042352	999999999	Moreover, when a constitutively active form of Akt in RBP2-siRNA2 H1975 cells was expressed, the expression of HIF-1a and VEGF were increased compared to the control; the PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002 significantly inhibited the expression of HIF-1a and VEGF in pcDNA3-HA-RBP2 SK-MES-1 cells (Fig. 7B).
SEN:10042354	999999999	As shown in Fig. 7D, in the presence of recombinant human VEGF-165 stimulation, the activation of Akt was increased in RBP2-depleted H1975 cells and RBP2-overexpressing SK-MES-1 cells (25 ng/mL, 30 minutes).
